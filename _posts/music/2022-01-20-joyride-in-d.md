This upbeat track is an offshoot of [Morning Rush](/posts/morning-rush/), spawned from a melody in the latter's interlude. Couldn't resist going ham on the drums.

Unlike [Breath of Life](/posts/breath-of-life/) and Morning Rush, this piece doesn't have any particular meaning imbued into it, just a fun little composition. I enjoyed writing the keyboard solo (although in its current state, it's not exactly playable), as well as the guitar countermelody at 2:50. Also writing for drums wasn't as boring as I thought.

This is the third of my three 2021 compositions, uploaded to mark the start of 2022. Enjoy.
