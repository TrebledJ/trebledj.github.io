Something about the past few years has been very poignant -- deep, memorable, touching yet almost hurting, somewhat close but also far, a bit cold but also evoking warm feelings.

This is a piece composed as a final project for an introductory course to music composition. Originally, I wanted the piece to be faster and more brisk (akin to a stressed state of mind). But after some reflection (and on further advice by instructors), I settled with a slower tempo. Following further modifications, the final result attempts to capture a held back, cold yet comforting, and ultimately poignant mood.
