### Joining the Team
My first encounter with the Robotics team was in a recruitment email inviting undergraduates to partake in an experience workshop. The workshop was free! And I was a bubbly, excited Year 1 student. So of course I signed up.

The experience workshop was quite fun. We were provided a chassis with motors a bit like the one in the picture below. Our task was to use the robot to guide (dribble?) a ping-pong ball along a path within a fixed time (IIRC it was 60 seconds?).

Software-wise we used Arduino to program the controller. I've never touched Arduino before, but they do a good job of abstracting a lot of low-level functionality. It was fun programming the robot to receive commands (e.g. turn left, turn right) and controlling the motors to respond.
