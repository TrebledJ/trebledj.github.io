Alike [Morning Ecstasy](/posts/morning-ecstasy), this piece was also composed in 2020 Spring, during the first several months of the Covid-19 pandemic. In addition, this was composed as a project for an (introductory) course on music theory.

In this piece, the string ensemble provides a steady cacophony of short buoyant sounds as the oboe takes us to various places... well, technically only two places - the major and the minor. I focused more on melody writing, accompaniment, and harmony; and less on instrumental technique ~and playability~. There were several things I could've improved, e.g. the technique of the oboe, perhaps transposing to a lower key so that the oboe isn't too shrill. Also this is a software rendition, so the audio quality isn't too good. Perhaps next time.
