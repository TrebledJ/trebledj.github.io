Huh? There are notes in between notes?

Microtonal music is a style of music that goes beyond the traditional Western tuning system. In a traditional diatonic system, an octave is divided into twelve equally-spaced notes. In microtonal music, the octave is divided into smaller intervals, allowing for a broader range of pitches and new tonal possibilities. It explores the spaces between the conventional notes, offering a unique and often experimental sonic experience for music enthusiasts.
