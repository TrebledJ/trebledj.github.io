> Every morning will soon turn into evening,  
> And springtime will soon turn into fall.  
> Every memory must fade, like a passing parade,  
> And youth become a time you just recall.
>  
> But the good times together seem so magical,  
> Like music that lasts your whole life through.  
> When it's ended, it never really dies away,  
> 'Cause the music's always there with you...
