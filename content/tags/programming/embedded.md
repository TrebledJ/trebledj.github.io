title: Embedded
---

A field of software development attributed to the development of embedded systems. You can think of these as computers, but without the fancy GUI and keyboard, and with many open-ended protocols and sockets (peripherals) to connect with other components. Embedded systems (in particular, IoT) are all around us: headphones, elevators, car monitors, heaters, etc. They're also used heavily in [robotics](/tags/robotics).
