C++ is a general-purpose {% tag "programming" %} language created by Danish computer scientist Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of {% tag "C", "c" %}, or "C with Classes". The language has expanded significantly over time, and modern C++ now has object-oriented, generic, and functional features in addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello world!" << std::endl;
}
```
