A robust {% tag "C++", "cpp" %} framework for developing cross-platform solutions.

One doesn't appreciate Qt until one realises it's pervasiveness among desktop apps such as:

- MuseScore: music notation and playback software
- WireShark: packet sniffer and analyser
- VirtualBox: cross-platform VM
- OBS: screencast software
- [and more!](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qt_(software)#Qt_in_use)

All awesome apps!
