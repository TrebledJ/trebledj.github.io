Scala is a strong statically typed general-purpose {% tag "programming" %} language which supports both object-oriented programming and functional programming. Designed to be concise, many of Scala's design decisions are aimed to address criticisms of Java.

```scala
object HelloWorld {
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    println("Hello world!")
  }
}
```
