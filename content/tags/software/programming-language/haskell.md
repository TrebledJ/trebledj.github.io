Haskell is a general-purpose, statically-typed, purely functional {% tag "programming" %} language with type inference and lazy evaluation. Designed for teaching, research and industrial applications, Haskell has pioneered a number of programming language features such as type classes, which enable type-safe operator overloading.

```haskell
main :: IO ()
main = putStrLn "Hello world!"
```
