JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled [programming](/tags/programming) language with first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js. JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles.

```js
console.log("Hello world!");
```
