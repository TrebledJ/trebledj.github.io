Capture the Flag (CTF) are cybersecurity competitions where participants hunt for flags (pieces of text like `flag{h3l1o_tH3Re}`) hidden inside vulnerable executables, applications, files, and whatnot. These competitions are usually held in one of two formats. The most common format is *jeopardy*, where each challenge is contained in a separate box and has a number of points attached.
