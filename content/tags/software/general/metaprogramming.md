Metaprogramming is a programming technique where we write code to manipulate or generate code. Essentially, we write code... *that writes code*! With metaprogramming, we can create reusable code templates, automate repetitive tasks, and even extend the capabilities of the programming language itself! It's a powerful tool that empowers programmers to write more flexible and efficient code by leveraging the language's own features to manipulate and generate code dynamically.
