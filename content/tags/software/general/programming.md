The act of pushing buttons in a manner to communicate with machines and human beans. I enjoy programming in a variety of languages, be it {% tag "C++", "cpp" %}, {% tag "Python", "python" %}, {% tag "Haskell", "haskell" %}, {% tag "Rust", "rust" %}, or {% tag "English", "essay" %}. Posts from this tag largely pertain to {% tag "software engineering", "software-engineering" %} and walkthroughs/{% tag "tutorials", "tutorial" %} related to programming.
