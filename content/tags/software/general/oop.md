title: Object-Oriented Programming
---

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm: a "way of programming", or a "way-of-thought" if you will. It is often contrasted with {% tag "functional programming", "fp" %}. OOP operates on classes—the building blocks of OOP—from which hierarchies of classes and relationships are built to model a domain or problem.

{% tag "Programming languages", "programming-languages" %} such as {% tag "C++", "cpp" %}, {% tag "Python", "python" %}, and {% tag "Scala", "scala" %} support OOP.
