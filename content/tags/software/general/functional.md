Functional Programming (FP) is a programming paradigm: a "way of programming", or a "way-of-thought" if you will. It is often contrasted with {% tag "object-oriented programming", "oop" %}. FP operates on data and types. It emphasises functions and pure code (no mutation of state or data, favours copying).

{% tag "Programming languages", "programming-languages" %} such as {% tag "Haskell", "haskell" %}, {% tag "Rust", "rust" %}, and {% tag "Scala", "scala" %} support FP.
