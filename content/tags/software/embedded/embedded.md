A field of {% tag "software development", "software-engineering" %} which combines software (programming) and hardware (embedded systems). You can think of these as computers, but without the fancy GUI and keyboard, and with many open-ended protocols, sockets, and peripherals to connect with other components. Embedded systems are all around us: headphones, elevators, car monitors, heaters, etc. They're also widely used in {% tag "IoT", "iot" %} and {% tag "robotics" %}.
