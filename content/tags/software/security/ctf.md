A *Capture the Flag* (CTF) is a competition where participants hunt for flags (pieces of text such as `flag{some_unique_text_or_hopefully_meaningful_message}`) hidden inside vulnerable executables, applications, files, and whatnot. These competitions are usually held in the jeopardy format, where each challenge is contained in a separate box and has a number of points attached.

It is a hacking competition, not in the sense of destroying things or developing lousy business ideas, but in breaking things apart to understand how they work and discovering new ways of doing things.
