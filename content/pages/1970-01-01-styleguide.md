### Lists

#### Unordered

Fruits:

- Apples
- Bananas
- Coconuts
- Doughnuts
- Oranges

Unordered lists, also known as bullet lists, are a useful way to present information in a structured and easily scannable manner. Here are some reasons why unordered lists are beneficial:

- Visual clarity: Unordered lists provide a clear visual representation of individual items or points. Each item is typically preceded by a bullet point or another marker, making it easy for readers to identify separate elements.

- Simplified organization: Lists help organize information into concise and manageable chunks. They allow for the categorization of related ideas or items, enabling readers to quickly grasp the main points or components being presented.

- Readability and comprehension: By breaking down complex information into bullet points, unordered lists enhance readability and comprehension. Readers can scan the list and focus on specific items of interest without getting overwhelmed by lengthy paragraphs.

- Prioritization and emphasis: Lists enable the author to prioritize items by placing them at the beginning or end of the list, or by using formatting techniques such as bold or italics. This helps draw attention to important details and ensures that key points are not overlooked.

- Sequential or non-sequential information: Unordered lists are suitable for both sequential and non-sequential information. They can present steps in a process or instructions in a logical order, as well as present unrelated or loosely related items that don't require a specific sequence.

#### Ordered

1. First, you take a soap bar.
2. You wring it out dry, using your favourite hair dryer.
3. Next, you take royal honey, from the royalist bees.
4. You cook the honey, let it steam for 20 minutes, meticulously adding seasoning such as garnished carbon and torn hair.
5. Once the honey has steamed well, it should stick profusely to the wok. Breathe into it.
6. ~~Extract~~ Untame the stuck honey, and crumbulate it in the Rockwell *dual-gyzmo combobulator*.
7. Finally, to ensure everything works out, and you don't violate time-space operation principles, you [***shove it up your butt***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a8LaIME66M).

Let's try that again.

#### Spacing

1. First, you take a soap bar.

    You wring it out dry, using your favourite hair dryer.

    > As a famous person once said, a dry soap is better a dead horse. - Anon.

2. Next, you take royal honey, from the royalist bees.

    ```c
    printf("Bzzz... target acquired~");
    ```

    You cook the honey, let it steam for 20 minutes, meticulously adding seasoning such as garnished carbon and torn hair.

3. Once the honey has steamed well, it should stick profusely to the wok. Breathe into it.
   
    {% alert "warning" %}  
        Make sure the **honey** is as *yellow* as this box. If not, you may have accidentally steamed royal pee instead of royal honey.^[Royal pee is an extreme form of royal honey, but boasts different characteristics, which aren't enough to fit the margin of this page. It's great for other recipes though.]  
    {% endalert %}

4. ~~Extract~~ Untame the stuck honey, and crumbulate it in the Rockwell *dual-gyzmo combobulator*.

### Math

Inline math is useful: $A + B + \underbrace{C + D}_{\small\text{Floppy disk!}}$.
Fractions are fun. $\frac{1024}{4096} = 25$

Monospaced math: $\texttt{char} \subset \texttt{int} \subset \texttt{long}$.

But centred equations are also fun!

$$
\begin{align}
x + y + z &= \frac{1}{4} \\\\
2x - y + 3z &= 2 \\\\
4x - 5y + 10z &= 3 \\\\
\end{align}
$$

Check line breaks here:

- $\texttt{Maybe} {} \goodbreak \texttt{(Either (a, a) (Bool, a))} {} \goodbreak \equiv \texttt{(Maybe a, Maybe a)}$
- $Maybe (Either (a, a) (Bool, a)) {} \goodbreak \equiv (Maybe a, Maybe a)$
- $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 \break + \cdots + 15 + 20 + 25 \break + \cdots + 100 + 200 + 300 \break + \cdots + 500 + 100 + 1500 \break + \cdots + \cdots + \cdots + 0 \break = -1$

## Custom

### Tags

Standalone: {% tag "programming" %} {% tag "software-engineering" %}

In {% tag "tutorial" %} between {% tag "cpp" %} words {% tag "haskell" %}, well, {% tag "music" %} it {% tag "learning" %} seems to work.

With {% tag "thoughts", "reflection" %} aliases {% tag "meddlings", "composition" %}, {% tag "diatribe", "essay" %}.

### Abbreviations

{% abbr "Hi", "Hello world!" %}, with {% abbr "**bold**", "BOLD!" %}, with {% abbr "*emphasis*", "EMPHASIS!" %}, with {% abbr "~~strikethrough~~", "such ninja!" %}, with {% abbr "`code`", "</>" %}.

Does it work with {% abbr '{% tag "tags", "meta" %}', 'Probably not...' %}?

Bears eat beets.
Bears, beets, battlestar galactica.
{% endalert %}

{% alert "info" %}
According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly.

Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't *care* what humans think is impossible.

`.` stands for function {% tag "composition" %}, similar to those in math ($f \circ g$). On the practical side, it applies the right-hand-side function first, followed by the left-hand-side function. $ 1 \mapsto 1 $ :)
