**Disclaimer**: I am *not* a lawyer; but I believe data privacy and transparency is important in the information age. This privacy policy exists to outline existing third-party services used on this site and how your personal data may be used.

## Introduction

**{{ site.title }}** is committed to protecting your privacy and security. This privacy policy explains how we collect, use, and protect personal data, and the choices you have regarding that data.

## Data Collection

We collect the following personal data:

* **Technical Data**: IP address, Browser type, Device type, Referrer data.
	* This is collected by GitHub Pages, Cloudflare Web Analytics, Disqus, and jsDelivr.
	* **{{ site.title }}** will only access such data in aggregate forms, and thus won't (be able to) link this data back to you.
	* This data is provided automatically by your browser when you load a web page. A VPN may be used to suppress or hide such data.
* **Cookies**
	* This is data associated with you and may be used by third-party services to track you.
	* Used by Disqus and SoundCloud embeds.
	* Cloudflare and jsDelivr claim they don't use cookies. ([Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/web-analytics/#:~:text=Cloudflare%20Web%20Analytics%20does%20not,the%20purpose%20of%20displaying%20analytics.); [jsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/terms/privacy-policy-jsdelivr-net#:~:text=We%20do%20not%20use%20cookies))
* **Identity Data**: Name, Email address.
	* These are **optional** fields in the [Contact Form](/#contact). You have the discretion to *not* fill in those fields.

## Data Usage

We use personal data for the following purposes:

- **Technical Data**: To optimise website experience. To draw insights on readers and to improve the site.
- **Identity Data**: For contact purposes. To respond to comments.

Third-party services may have other clauses. Please refer to their [privacy policies](#third-party).

## Data Sharing

We do not share your personal data with third-parties. Any personal data collected by third-parties were obtained when you load the page, use a third-party account, or voluntarily submit your identity data.

## Data Protection, Retention, and Rights

Whilst personal data helps us improve the site, such data does not reside with us, but with third-party services. For policies on data protection, retention, and rights to access/correct/delete, please refer to their [privacy policies](#third-party) for details.
