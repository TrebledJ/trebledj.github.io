Zip files are *everywhere* in our daily lives, seamlessly integrated into our personal, academic, and professional environments. From Java apps to Microsoft Office documents, zip files have become an indispensable tool.

But as we know from *Silicon Valley*, zip files have the potential to be dangerous.^[Relevant YouTube: [Silicon Valley - The Ultimate Hack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnDk8BcqoR0)]

{% image "assets/its-a-zip-bomb.gif", "w-80", "Filmmakers' impression of a zip bomb." %}

In this post, we'll delve into the intriguing world of zip file attacks, exploring various attacks and mitigations involving zip files. Such [attacks](#zip-attacks) allow attackers to gain unauthorized read and write privilegesâ€”or even cause denial of service. With [mitigations](#mitigations-and-other-considerations), we can better protect our systems against zip threats through the cooperation of different teams.

<!-- TODO: consider where to put these statements. Rationale at end? Playground at front of attack? -->
I decided to write this post since I recently designed a CTF challenge involving a zip file upload attack, and I wanted a place to concisely ~~jot~~ present my notes and research. Examples in this post will draw from this CTF challenge.

I've uploaded a modified Docker playground on [GitHub](TODO: link). Feel free to build it locally (Docker required) and play with various zip attacks to be discussed later.

## Zip Attacks

{% image "assets/evil-zip-unveiled.jpg", "w-50", "" %}

### Zip Slip â›¸

#### Overview of Zip Slip

**Zip Slip** is a fancy name for [directory traversal](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html) but applied to zip uploads. The idea is to *escape* a directory by visiting parent directories through `../` (or `..\\` on Windows). This allows unauthorised access to files and directories by exploiting the lack of *proper input validation* in file path parameters.

Let's look at an example.

A typical zip file may look like this:

```text
foo.zip
â””â”€â”€ data1.csv
â””â”€â”€ data2.txt
â””â”€â”€ ...
```

But in a Zip Slip payload, files are prefixed with nasty double-dots (`../`).

```text
evil-slip.zip
â””â”€â”€ ../../root/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

If a vulnerable application unzips `evil-slip.zip` to `/app/uploads/`, then our unzipped file would end up in `/app/uploads/../../root/.ssh/authorized_keys`, i.e. `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys`.

{% alert "fact" %}
Overwriting `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` is a common attack vector which can be applied in other file upload scenarios too! The flow goes like so:

1. Generate a public/private SSH key (`ssh-keygen`).
2. Exploit any file write trickery to write our public key to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` (on the victim).
3. SSH to the victim.[^ssh]
4. Profit! Run arbitrary commands.

[^ssh]: But for this to work, the container needs to be running `sshd` (or some program which handles SSH connections) and port 22 needs to be exposed.

But this isn't the only way to gain arbitrary code execution! There are other potential targets for an arbitrary file write (server credentials, config files, etc.).
{% endalert %}

#### DIY: Build your own Zip Slip payload!

{% details "With Python", "open" %}
Python's built-in `zipfile` module provides a flexible way to create zip files.

```python
import zipfile

with zipfile.ZipFile("evil-slip.zip", "w") as zip:
    zip.write("my-key.pub", "../.ssh/authorized_keys")
    #          â”‚             â”” filename to store on the archive
    #          â”” file to compress in our local file system
```

This creates a new `evil-slip.zip` zip file. We use write-mode (`"w"`) to *write* instead of read. (There is also `r` and `a` for reading/adding files.)

We also use Python's `with`, so that when the zip file saves automatically when we leave the block. (Alternatively, we could manually call `zip.close()`.)

Inside, we use `zip.write` to add files to the zip. We add a local file `my-key.pub` and provide store it with the filename `../.ssh/authorized_keys` in the archive.

One nice thing about `zipfile` is it constructs the file in memory without creating temporary files, allowing us to craft complex zips without trashing our local filesystem or using a VM.

{% enddetails %}

{% details "With Shell Commands" %}
Another approach is to use shell commands and reverse the process: starting with files we want unzipped.

```shell
$ touch ../.ssh/authorized_keys
# Normally we would run `ssh-keygen` to generate a key pair...
# and use the generated public key as our authorized_keys.
# But I'll assume ../.ssh/authorized_keys holds a public key.

$ zip evil-slip ../.ssh/authorized_keys
  adding: ../.ssh/authorized_keys (deflated 18%)
  
$ unzip -l evil-slip
Archive:  evil-slip.zip
  Length      Date    Time    Name
---------  ---------- -----   ----
      575  01-23-2024 17:53   ../.ssh/authorized_keys
---------                     -------
      575                     1 file
```

{% enddetails %}

#### Limitations of Zip Slip

- On Windows, you may need backslashes `\` instead of forward slashes `/`. This ultimately depends on the unzipping application/library.
- The app needs execute permissions on intermediate folders (to traverse across) and write permissions on the target folder.
  For instance, to write to `foo/bar/baz/flag.txt`, we need `x` permissions on `foo/` and `foo/bar/`; and `wx` permissions on `foo/bar/baz/`.


### Zip Symlink Attacks ðŸ–‡

Zip symlink attacks are just that: zip file attacks containing symlinks. There are several ways to build such a malicious zip. But before we continue, let's first clarify two types of symlinks in our arsenal:

1. Symlink Files. This allows us to potentially *read* arbitrary files.[^root]
2. Symlink Directories. This allows us to potentially *write files* to arbitrary folders.[^root]

[^root]: Assuming we run as `root`, or as long as permissions don't get in the way.


#### Arbitrary Read with File Symlinks

{% alert "info" %}
In this subsection, "Arbitrary Read" assumes the user has some way of accessing files on the system. For instance, perhaps the system hosts a web server which serves files from a particular directory.
{% endalert %}

Let's start with a simple example of a zip symlink payload. Here's a zip which contains a symlink to `/etc/passwd`.

```text
evil-link-file.zip
â””â”€â”€ passwd.txt         -> /etc/passwd
```

After uploading the zip and letting the app unzip it, the filesystem now resembles:

```text
app/
â””â”€â”€ uploads/
    â””â”€â”€ passwd.txt     -> /etc/passwd
```

If we can read files in `/app/uploads/`, then we can read `passwd.txt` and by extension, `/etc/passwd`.[^really-by-extension] Then GG! We can use this method to read any file on the system (subject to certain constraints to be discussed later).

[^really-by-extension]: Okay, I skipped some steps here, but didn't want to overcomplicate things. The long answer is: reading a symlink also depends on permissions of the {% abbr "source file", "the file linked by the symlink" %} and the {% abbr "source directory", "the directory containing the source file" %}. ***If*** we can read files in our upload directory **and** if we have sufficient permissions, then we can (potentially) have arbitrary read.

But... what if we *don't* have read access to `/app/uploads/`?

This is the case in our Docker playground. We can't access `/app/uploads/` from the browser... But! We can access files in `/app/static/`. This is the folder where static files (.html, .css, .js) are served from.

We would need to write our symlink to *that* folder first before reading it. One way is to use Zip Slip. But what if the application blocks zip files containing `../`? Is there an alternative way?


#### Arbitrary Write with Dir Symlinks

This is where things get fun. Let's slightly modify our zip by inserting a little indirection:

```text
evil-link-dir-file.zip
â””â”€â”€ dirlink/           -> /app/static/
    â””â”€â”€ passwd.txt     -> /etc/passwd
```

Now our zip contains a symlink directory! When unzipped, the vulnerable application will first create a symlink to `/app/static/`. Then inside that symlink, it creates *another* symlink, this time to `/etc/passwd`.

Let's see what the filesystem looks like now.

```text
app/
â””â”€â”€ uploads/
    â””â”€â”€ dirlink        -> /app/static/
â””â”€â”€ static/
    â””â”€â”€ passwd.txt     -> /etc/passwd
```

Now we can browse `https://localhost:8080/passwd.txt` to leak the contents of `/etc/passwd`.

This method can also be used to apply the same attack technique we tried in the Zip Slip section.


#### DIY: Build your own Zip Symlink Payload!

{% details "With Python", "open" %}
Like before, we can use Python to generate zip symlink payloads. We'll need some extra massaging with `ZipInfo` though.

```python
# evil-link-file.zip
# â””â”€â”€ passwd.txt         -> /etc/passwd
with zipfile.ZipFile("evil-link-file.zip", "w", compression=zipfile.ZIP_DEFLATED) as zip:
  info = zipfile.ZipInfo("passwd.txt")
  info.create_system = 0 # Linux => 0. Windows => 3.
  info.external_attr = (stat.S_IFLNK | 0o777) << 16 # File attributes.
  zip.writestr(info, "/etc/passwd")
```

For a double symlink attack, we just create another entry for the directory.

```diff-python
 # evil-link-dir-file.zip
 # â””â”€â”€ dirlink/           -> /app/static/
 #     â””â”€â”€ passwd.html    -> /etc/passwd
 with zipfile.ZipFile("evil-link-dir-file.zip", "w", compression=zipfile.ZIP_DEFLATED) as zip:
   # Order matters! Write dir first, then file.
+  info = zipfile.ZipInfo("dirlink")
+  info.create_system = 0
+  info.external_attr = (stat.S_IFLNK | 0o777) << 16
+  zip.writestr(info, "/app/static/")

   info = zipfile.ZipInfo("dirlink/passwd.txt") # Also change the filename here.
   info.create_system = 0
   info.external_attr = (stat.S_IFLNK | 0o777) << 16
   zip.writestr(info, "/etc/passwd")
```

{% enddetails %}

{% details "With Shell Commands" %}
Shell commands also work. (Make sure to use `-y`/`--symlinks` when zipping symlinks. Otherwise, you'd be adding your actual `/etc/passwd`!)

```sh
# Create our (soft) links.
ln -s /app/static/ dirlink
ln -s /etc/passwd dirlink/passwd.txt
# Zip the links.
zip -y evil-link-dir-file dirlink dirlink/passwd.txt
```

Note that this approach will leave leftover files to be cleaned up (or reused).
{% enddetails %}

#### Limitations of Zip Symlink Attacks

- Permissions on Linux.
  - To create a symlink, we need execute permissions in the source directory (where the linked file is located) and write/execute permissions in the target directory (where the symlink is created).[^ref-linuxlinkperm]
  - Reading a symlink requires execute permissions in the source directory, and read permissions on the source file.
- Permissions on Windows. By default, only Administrators have the privilege to [create symbolic links](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/create-symbolic-links). This setting can be changed by [editing the local group policy](https://superuser.com/a/105381) or by directly enabling `SeCreateSymbolicLinkPrivilege`.

[^ref-linuxlinkperm]: Reference: [SO: Minimum Permissions Required to Create a Link to a File](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40667014/linux-what-are-the-minimum-permissions-required-to-create-a-link-to-a-file)


### Zip Bombs ðŸ’£

Since we're talking about attacks, let's also cover zip bombs for completeness.

<!-- > Gavin: The f*** is happening?  
> Mark: Oh ðŸ’©, looks like a zip bomb, they must know it's us!  
> Bob: That hard drive if f****d.  
> Gavin: This is my personal laptop-  
> Brian: You opened a *stolen beta* on your *personal* computer?  
> Gavin: Yes. And installed it on my phone.  
>   â€” [Silicon Valley S3E7](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnDk8BcqoR0) -->

Zip bombs are designed to cripple computers, systems, and virus scanners (rather than read sensitive data or escalate privileges, like Zip Slip and symlink attacks). Much like the well-memed [fork bomb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_bomb), a zip bomb attempts to drain system resources.

{% images "h-auto" %}
{% image "https://i.redd.it/68j4sr9h3dg21.jpg" %}
{% image "https://img.devrant.com/devrant/rant/r_674011_CfdZB.jpg" %}
{% image "assets/unzip42.jpg" %}
{% endimages %}

<sup>Some fork bomb memes. And zip bomb memes adapted from fork bomb memes. Zip bomb memes where?^[There probably aren't as many memes on zip bombs as they tend to be a software bug which can be swiftly patched.]</sup>
{.caption}

The basic principle abuses the ***deflate***[^deflate] compression format to achieve compression ratios of up to [1032:1](https://stackoverflow.com/a/16794960/10239789). This means after compression, every byte of compressed data can represent *up to* 1032 bytes of uncompressed data.

Zip bombs approach this ratio by compressing a file with highly-repetitive patterns (e.g. all zeros) which can be counted and grouped compactly.

{% details "Why are highly-repetitive patterns 'easier to compress'?" %}
To see why repetitive patterns facilitate compression, consider an analogy with run-length encoding. If I want to compress `1111222233334444`, I might say `four 1s, four 2s, four 3s, four 4s` which has a compression ratio of 12 characters to 8 words. But if I want to compress `1111111111111111`, I can just say `twelve 1s`, which has a higher compression ratio of 12 characters to *2* words.
{% enddetails %}

[^deflate]: This is the same compression algorithm used in gzip (commonly used for transferring files across the web) and PNGs.

The well-known [42.zip](https://www.unforgettable.dk/) bomb is only 42KB, but contains 5 layers of zips upon zips. Unzipping the first layer yields a harmless 0.6MB. But recursively uncompressed, it yields an astronomical payload of {% abbr "4.5PB (petabytes, 15 zeros)", "4,503,599,626,321,920 bytes, to be exact" %}!

Most decompression tools and virus scanners are wary of zip bombs, and only unzip the first (few) layers or stop after identifying a zip file.
 
In 2019, David Fifield introduced *a better zip bomb*, which abuses the structure of a .zip, toying with metadata to trick decompressors into puking ungodly amounts of data. A compressed Fifield zip bomb of 42KB yields 5.4GB of uncompressed bytes. This metadata trickery is more generally known as **Metadata Spoofing**.

Fifield has written an excellent article on various techniques here: *https://www.bamsoftware.com/hacks/zipbomb/*. (It may be blocked on some browsers.)

#### DIY: Build your own Zip Bomb!

Here's a small demo:
```sh
# Create a blank file with 5GB of null bytes.
$ dd if=/dev/zero bs=20000 count=250000 >zero.txt

# Zip it.
$ zip test.zip test.txt

# Count the number of bytes.
$ wc -c zero.txt zero.zip
 5000000000 zero.txt
 4852639 zero.zip
 5004852639 total
```

From 5GB, we've gone down to ~4.9MB! Upload a bunch of these to a vulnerable site, and boomâ€”CPU helicopter.


## Other Zip Vulnerabilities in the Wild

Although I used Juce's [2021 symlink vulnerability](https://vulners.com/prion/PRION:CVE-2021-23521) for demonstration, zip vulnerabilities exist elsewhere too! Here are some notable ones:

- [Multiple Zip Vulnerabilities across Flutter and Swift Packages](https://blog.ostorlab.co/zip-packages-exploitation.html) (2023)
- [Zip Slip](https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2018-1000544) (2018) and [Metadata Spoofing](https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2019-16892/) (2019) in Rubyzip

Keep in mind zip files come in different forms. Here are some you might be familiar with:
- .docx, .pptx, .xlsx (Microsoft Documents),
- .jar (Java Archive),
- .apk (Android App),
- .mscx (MuseScore File).

Any service processing such files has potential to be vulnerable.


## Mitigations and Other Considerations

{% image "https://csis-website-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/publication/171212_cyber_Defense.jpg", "w-40 floatr1", "Credit: Cybrain/Adobe Stock" %}

So much for the offensive side. How about the defensive aspect? What approaches can we take to secure our systems?

Let's explore a few ways to mitigate zip attacks. (Some of these can also be applied to protect against other attacks, or may just be general improvements.)

### Permissions
*For sysadmins.*

In America, "all men are created equal". Not so in filesystems.

Reading, writing, and linking files depends on permissions. Setting appropriate permissions for the process and limiting the scope of an application can go a long way in preventing attackers from snooping your secrets.

{% alert "success" %}
1. Avoid running the application as `root`. Instead, run it with a minimum privilege user. (Minimum meaning: enough permissions to get the job done, and only enabling higher permissions when needed.)^[In Docker, we can configure permissions with `chown` and [`USER`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#user). (I intentionally left these out in the demo.)]
  
2. Lock down sensitive files, only allowing access to privileged users. For example, most server applications don't require write privileges to credential/config files.
{% endalert %}

Sometimes it's not entirely feasible to restrict all write permissions. For example, web servers may still need to write access logs.

See [Limitations of Zip Slip](#limitations-of-zip-slip) and [Limitations of Zip Symlink Attacks](#limitations-of-zip-symlink-attacks) for details on relevant permissions.

### Modern Antivirus
*For sysadmins and normies.*

Although zip bombs have targeted antivirus (AV) systems in the past, most [modern AV programs can detect zip bombs](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/learning-center/what-is-a-zip-bomb) by recognising patterns and signatures. This brings us to our last suggestion:

{% alert "success" %}
3. Upgrade your (antivirus) software. Daily updates to malware signatures ensure your antivirus program stays equipped to detect and thwart emerging threats.
{% endalert %}


### Robust Code and Tests
*For software developers **building/maintaining** zip libraries/applications.*

Verify your edge cases! Considering edge cases may require domain knowledge and experience, and extra time may be needed to research different scenarios, but hey, it makes for good Shift Left practice.

Here are a couple more recommendations:

{% alert "success" %}
4. Handle edge cases and add appropriate {% abbr "branches", "if-statements, guards, exception-handling, etc." %}.

    For a zip file application, you should ensure your code handles:
    - `..` (Zip Slip),^[Further, if the filename is decoded or gets fed to other servers, you should also handle URL encodings of `.` (`%2e`) and `/` (`%2f`), which are a common bypass against straightforward checks.]
    - symlinks (zip symlink attacks),
    - potential uncompressed file size (especially if your application targets end-users).

5. Adopt unit testing to verify your code works as intended. Add test cases against unintended situations.

    Test cases prevent [software regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_regression) and automate the menial task of manual input.

{% endalert %}

For example, Juce v6.1.5 introduced several fixes:

- They [added a check](https://github.com/juce-framework/JUCE/commit/2e874e80cba0152201aff6a4d0dc407997d10a7f#diff-16f78a017ef48e7154eac2ea6b3ee3d211fa508f5465db0c7f2667741ca00265R438-R440) to prevent arbitrary write attacks:

  ```cpp
  if (!fileToUnzip.isAChildOf(directoryToUnzipTo))
    // Attack attempt detected: attempted write outside of unzip directory.
    return Result::fail("...");
  ```

- They also added a [test case against Zip Slip](https://github.com/juce-framework/JUCE/commit/2e874e80cba0152201aff6a4d0dc407997d10a7f#diff-16f78a017ef48e7154eac2ea6b3ee3d211fa508f5465db0c7f2667741ca00265R700).


And while we're on the topic of software development, having sensible defaults in libraries and application goes a long way.

{% alert "success" %}
6. Use defaults such as:

   - Don't follow symlink directories.^[There are other solutions as well. The `unzip` binary found on Unix systems handles symlinks by deferring linkage until *all* files have been uncompressed.]
   - Don't overwrite files. You don't want your files wiped out, right?

    It's a good idea to keep these defaults, unless you really need these features, and you're confident with the level of risk you're dealing with.

{% endalert %}

## Concluding Remarks

To recap, here are some main points we've gathered:

- There are generally three streams of zip attacks at large:
  - Arbitrary Read/Write with Zip Slip
  - Arbitrary Read/Write with Zip Symlink Attacks
  - Denial of Service with Zip Bombs and Metadata Spoofing
- Ways to counter zip attacks include:
  - Run applications with a minimum privilege user.
  - Regularly update your antivirus with new signatures.
  - Adopt strong software development practices, including error handling, unit tests, and secure defaults.
