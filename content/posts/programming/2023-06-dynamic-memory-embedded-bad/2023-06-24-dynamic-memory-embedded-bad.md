I keep explaining why dynamically allocating on embedded systems is a disagreeable idea, so thought Iâ€™d throw it on a post. This is a confusing topic for many junior developers who were taught to use `new` and `delete` in early C++ courses. In desktop/web application programming, dynamic allocation is everywhere.^[Even if you donâ€™t use it directly, itâ€™s still there. Most garbage-collected languages (think Java, JS, Python) will allocate primitives on the stack, and all other objects on a heap.] Not so in embedded.

To clarify, dynamic memory allocation (in embedded) isn't *always* bad, just as [`goto` isn't *always* bad](https://stackoverflow.com/a/3517765/10239789). Both dynamic allocation and `goto` have appropriate uses, but are often misused. As engineers, it's our duty to understand which situations call for these features and to make sound choices.

Not only is allocation an issue. Virtual classes, exceptions, runtime type information (RTTI)â€”these are all no-nos for some embedded companies. They're all avoided for the same reasons: performance degradation and code bloat. In essence, not enough time and not enough space. With dynamic memory, there's another reason.

## So why is dynamic memory bad?

Because of **Memory Fragmentation**. This occurs when we keep allocating and deallocating memory in various sizes. This may lead to wasted memory, leading to slower allocations (due to the need to reallocate and compact memory) or our worst nightmare: an out-of-memory exception. ðŸ¤¯

<sup>Memory becomes fragmented after multiple allocs and deallocs, leading to wasted memory space. ([source](https://er.yuvayana.org/memory-fragmentation-in-operating-system/))</sup>

Since embedded systems tend to require sustained uptime, constantly using dynamic memory may lead to highly fragmented memory.

This is a serious issue. Persistence, backup, and resets should be considered when developing embedded applications, but buggy resetsâ€”say, due to {% abbr "OOM", "out-of-memory" %} crashesâ€”should be avoided. Maybe not an issue if you're working with [missiles](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20180228-00/?p=98125) though.

## What alternatives are there?

In C, dynamic allocation is largely optional; you, the programmer, have more control over memory usage.^[Also, the C standard library rarely depends on dynamic allocation; except maybe for file IO.]

In C++, it's more of a hassle. Dynamic memory allocation is core to many standard library containers: strings, vectors, maps. The Arduino `String` also uses dynamic memory. No doubt, these libraries are immensely useful for organising and manipulating data, but they come with dynamic allocation.^[Sure, `std` containers allow custom allocators, and that can be a topic for an entire series of posts... but it also means additional indirection, whether at compile-time or runtime.]

The alternative is to use **static allocation**, by providing a maximum bound to our allocations. Sometimes, it's as simple as changing your array declarations.

```cpp
// --- Dynamic ---

size_t size = 10;
int* array1 = new int[size];

// Use the array...
for (int i = 0; i < size; i++)
    array1[i] = i;

delete[] array1;


// --- Static ---

// Define a maximum capacity...
#define MAX_SIZE 100                // ...with a macro,
// constexpr size_t MAX_SIZE = 100; // ...or use C++'s type-safe constexpr.

int array2[MAX_SIZE];

// Use the array... (be careful to use `size` instead of `MAX_SIZE`).
for (int i = 0; i < size; i++)
    array2[i] = i;
```

With complex data structures, more work is needed to eliminate dynamic allocation.Â This is what ETL containers achieve, as opposed to STL containers.

{% alert "success" %}
The [ETL](https://github.com/ETLCPP/etl) (Embedded Template Library) is an alternative to the C++ standard library, and contains many standard features plus libraries useful for embedded systems programming (e.g. circular buffers).

```cpp
// STL
// Allocate a dynamic vector (on the heap). Capacity grows on-demand.
std::vector<int> vec1 = {1,2,3};

// ETL
// Allocate a static vector (on the stack) with fixed capacity.
etl::vector<int, 10> vec2 = {1,2,3};
```
{% endalert %}

One benefit of static allocation is *speed*. With dynamic, allocators need to figure out size constraints and reallocate. If the allocator is good, it may save time by reusing a previously freed bin; but this still consumes time. With *static*, memory is either pre-allocated (in the case of global variables) or allocated with a single instruction (subtracting the stack pointer).^[And if your function uses multiple statically-allocated variables, the allocation will be combined in one *giant* stack subtraction. You can thank your compiler for this static bonus.] Hence, better performance at the expense of flexibility.

{% alert "fact" %}
What about polymorphism? We can achieve static polymorphism via [CRTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curiously_recurring_template_pattern#Static_polymorphism); but we lose the ability for a polymorphic container (e.g. `vector<Animal*>`, `vector<Shape*>`). We could also use sum types (e.g. [`std::variant`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/variant)); but this increases the memory footprint. Sometimes virtual classes are a necessary ~~evil~~ abstraction.
{% endalert %}

Thus, itâ€™s crucial to consider the design requirements of the software being developed. How long do the strings need to be? Can they be limited by a maximum length? How many items will our vector hold at most? Is it more maintainable to use virtual classes here? 

## Is dynamic memory always bad?

Dynamic memory isn't bad in all cases, if used properly. Some appropriate situations:

- You only allocate during init. For example, we want to allocate memory based on a setting from a config file, and that setting doesn't change throughout runtime.
- It's difficult to decide on a maximum bound. To quote a [Reddit comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/embedded/comments/8rc2vz/comment/e0qmr9s):
    
    > Since networking like what [ESP32] IDF is used in is so extremely variable in data sizes, it's impossible to predict memory usage up front. Furthermore, networking is extremely not hard real time compatible, especially wireless. All these combined relax the constraints and allow the usage of malloc.

There are [various ways to implement dynamic memory allocation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_management). The "best" method depends on your specific scenario. [Memory pools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_pool) are one implementation admired for their simplicity and lightweight nature. FreeRTOS documents other [heap implementations](https://www.freertos.org/a00111.html) which aim to be thread-safe. [Heap 4](https://www.freertos.org/a00111.html#heap_4) is of particular interest, as it mitigates fragmentation.

## Summary

In a recent discussion between Uncle Bob and Casey Muratori on clean code and performance, Bob summarises:

> Switch statements have their place. Dynamic polymorphism has its place. **Dynamic things are more flexible than static things, so when you want that flexibility, and you can afford it, go dynamic. If you can't afford it, stay static.**

<sup>([source](https://github.com/unclebob/cmuratori-discussion/blob/main/programmer-cycles-vs-machine-cycles.md); emphasis added)</sup>

This applies to embedded system memory as well. Itâ€™s difficult to afford dynamic things with few resources. With more powerful MCUs, itâ€™s easier to justify dynamic things, be it heap, polymorphism, and whatnot. In the end, we should take into account the available resources, design requirements, and use cases. Let me summarise again. *If you **need** flexibility and can afford it, use dynamic memory. If you canâ€™t afford it (as is often the case), use static.*^[The distinction between *want* and *need* is small, but IMO important when programming for embedded systems. Sometimes, we may *want* to use the heap, but it's not needed. Very rarely, we may *need* the flexibility of the heap since the benefits outweigh the costs.]
