Ah‚Ä¶ embedded systems‚Äîthe intersection of robust hardware and versatile software.

This is the third (and culminating) post in a series on digital audio synthesis. In the [first post](/posts/digital-audio-synthesis-for-dummies-part-1), we introduced basic concepts on audio processing. In the [second post](/posts/digital-audio-synthesis-for-dummies-part-2), we dived into audio synthesis and generation.

In this post, we‚Äôll discover how to effectively implement an audio synthesiser and player on an embedded device by marrying hardware (timers, {% abbr "DACs", "Digital-to-Analogue Converters; explained later!" %}, {% abbr "DMA", "Direct Memory Access; explained later!" %}) and software (double buffering plus other optimisations).[^subtopics]

[^subtopics]: Each of these components (especially hardware) deserve their own post to be properly introduced; but for the sake of keeping this post short, I‚Äôll only introduce them briefly and link to other resources for further perusal.

To understand these concepts even better, we‚Äôll look at examples on an {% abbr "STM32", "A family of 32-bit microcontrollers." %}. These examples are inspired from a [MIDI keyboard project](/posts/stm32-midi-keyboard) I previously worked on.
I'll be using an STM32F405RGT board in the examples. If you plan to follow along with your own board, make sure it's capable of timer-triggered DMA and DAC.

{% alert "simple" %}
This post is much longer than I expected. My suggested approach of reading is to first gain a high-level understanding, then dig into the examples for details.
{% endalert %}

## Timers ‚è≥

It turns out kitchens and embedded systems aren‚Äôt that different after all! Both perform input and output, and both have timers! Who knew? Tick-Tock Croc, perhaps.[^ticktock]

[^ticktock]: I think it's safe to say that Tick-Tock Croc also performs input-output and has a timer between his eyes. So Tick-Tock isn't too different from a kitchen! Or an embedded controller, for that matter.

{% image "assets/tick-tock.jpg", "Tick tock likey embedded timers?", "post1 w-90" %}

<br/>  

### Tick Tock

Timers in embedded systems are similar to those in the kitchen: they tick for a period of time and signal an event when finished. However, embedded timers are much fancier than kitchen timers, making them immensely useful in various applications. They can trigger repeatedly (via auto-reload), count up/down, and be used to generate rectangular (PWM) waves.

So what makes timers tick?

The {% abbr "MCU", "Microcontroller Unit. No, not the Marvel Cinematic Universe!" %} clock!

{% alert "fact" %}
The MCU clock is the *backbone* of a controller. It controls the processing speed and pretty much everything!‚Äîtimers, ADC, DAC, communication protocols, and whatnot.

The clock runs at a fixed frequency (168MHz on our board).
By dividing against it, we can achieve lower frequencies.
{% endalert %}

The following diagram illustrates how the clock signal is divided on an STM. There are two divisors: the prescaler and auto-reload (aka counter period).

{% image "assets/timing-diagram.jpg", "Timing diagram of timer signal derived from a clock signal.", "post1" %}

<sup>Deriving timer frequency from the clock signal. (Diagram adapted from uPesy.^[[How do microcontroller timers work?](https://www.upesy.com/blogs/tutorials/how-works-timers-in-micro-controllers) ‚Äì A decent article on timers. Diagrams are in French though.])</sup>
{.caption}

Here, the clock signal is first divided by a prescaler of 2, then further "divided" by an auto-reload of 6. On every overflow (arrow shooting up), the timer triggers an interrupt. Thus, the timer runs at $\frac{1}{12}$ the speed of the clock.

These interrupts can trigger functionality such as DMA transfers (explored later) and ADC conversions.^[The extent of timer events depends on hardware support. Timers can do a lot on ST boards. For other brands, you may need to check the datasheet or reference manual.]
Heck, they can even be used to trigger other timers!

  - There are more prescalers behind the scenes! (APB2)

### Example: Initialising the Timer

Suppose we want to send a stream of audio output. We can use a timer with a frequency set to our desired [sample rate](notion://www.notion.so/posts/digital-audio-synthesis-for-dummies-part-1#sampling).

We can derive the prescaler and auto-reload by finding any integer factors that satisfy the relationship:

$$
\text{freq}\_\text{timer} = \frac{\text{freq}\_\text{clock}}{(\text{PSC} + 1) \times (\text{ARR} + 1)}
$$

where $\text{freq}\_\text{timer}$ is the timer frequency (or specifically in our case, the sample rate) and $\text{freq}\_\text{clock}$ is the clock frequency. PSC and ARR are registers used to divide the clock signal.

On our STM32F405, we configured $\text{freq}\_\text{clock}$ to the maximum possible speed: 168MHz. If we‚Äôre aiming for an output sample rate of 42,000Hz, we‚Äôd need to divide our clock signal by 4,000, so that we correctly get $\frac{168,000,000}{4,000} = 42,\\!000$. For now, we‚Äôll choose register values of `PSC = 0` and `ARR = 3999`.

{% alert "fact" %}
Why do we add $+1$ to the PSC and ARR in the relationship above?

The PSC and ARR are 16-bit *registers*, meaning they range from 0 to 65,535. To save space and enhance program correctness, we assign meaningful behaviour to the value 0.
{% endalert %}

{% alert "fact" %}
Why `0` and `3999`?

Different pairs of PSC and ARR work, as long as they satisfy the relationship.

You can play around and try different pairs of PSC and ARR.
I suggest coming back to this section after getting DAC + DMA + double buffering to work, and experiment!

Exercises for the reader:

* What is the difference between different pairs, such as `PSC = 0`, `ARR = 3999` vs. `PSC = 1`, `ARR = 1999`? (Hint: counter.)
* Is there a PSC/ARR pair that is "better"? What if we're using the timer to generate a PWM signal?
{% endalert %}

We can use STM32 CubeMX, a GUI for configuring hardware, to initialise timer parameters. CubeMX allows us to generate code from these options, handling the conundrum of modifying the appropriate registers.

{% image "assets/stm32-cubemx-timer-1.jpg", "Timer settings from CubeMX.", "post1" %}

<sup>In CubeMX, we first select a timer on the left. We then enable a channel (here Channel 4) to generate PWM.[^chtim] We also set the prescaler and auto-reload so that our timer frequency is 42,000Hz.</sup>
{.caption}

[^chtim]: We chose Timer 8 (with Channel 4) because it's an advanced control timer (a beefy boi!), capable of a lot, though probably overkill for our simple examples. The timer and channel you use depends on your STM board and model. If you‚Äôre following along with this post, make sure to choose a timer which has DMA generation. When in doubt, refer to the reference manual.[^rm0090]

{% image "assets/stm32-cubemx-timer-2-raw.jpg", "More timer settings from CubeMX.", "post1" %}

<sup>Some other settings in CubeMX to check.</sup>
{.caption}

Remember to generate code once done.[^codegen] CubeMX should generate the following code in `main.c`:

[^codegen]: In CubeMX, you can generate code by choosing the *Project* > *Generate Code* menu option. Keep in mind that only code between `USER CODE BEGIN` and `USER CODE END` comments will be preserved by ST's code generator.

```cpp
static void MX_TIM8_Init(void)
{
    // --snip-- Initialise structs. --snip--

    htim8.Instance               = TIM8;
    htim8.Init.Prescaler         = 0;
    htim8.Init.CounterMode       = TIM_COUNTERMODE_UP;
    htim8.Init.Period            = 4000 - 1;
    htim8.Init.ClockDivision     = TIM_CLOCKDIVISION_DIV1;
    htim8.Init.RepetitionCounter = 0;
    htim8.Init.AutoReloadPreload = TIM_AUTORELOAD_PRELOAD_DISABLE;
    if (HAL_TIM_Base_Init(&htim8) != HAL_OK) {
        Error_Handler();
    }
    
    // --snip-- Initialise the clock source. --snip--
    
    if (HAL_TIM_PWM_Init(&htim8) != HAL_OK) {
        Error_Handler();
    }
    
    // --snip-- Initialise other things. --snip--
    
    HAL_TIM_MspPostInit(&htim8);
}
```

After initialisation, it's possible to change the timer frequency by setting the prescaler and auto-reload registers like so:

```cpp
TIM8->PSC = 0;    // Prescaler: 1
TIM8->ARR = 3999; // Auto-Reload: 4000
```

This is useful for applications where the frequency is dynamic (e.g. playing music with a piezoelectric buzzer), but it's also useful when we're too lazy to modify the .ioc file.


### Example: Playing with Timers

STM‚Äôs HAL library provides ready-made functions to interface with hardware. 

```cpp
HAL_TIM_Base_Start(&htim8); // Start the timer.
HAL_TIM_Base_Stop(&htim8);  // Stop the timer.
```

These functions are used to start/stop timers for basic timing and counting applications.
Functions for more specialised modes (e.g. PWM) are available in `stm32f4xx_hal_tim.h`.


## Digital-to-Analogue Converters (DACs) üåâ

Let's delve into our second topic today: digital-to-analogue converters (DACs).

Audio is comes in several forms: sound waves (physical analogue), electrical voltages (analogue), and binary data (digital).

{% image "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c7/CPT-Sound-ADC-DAC.svg/1200px-CPT-Sound-ADC-DAC.svg.png", "Tolkien's world looks nothing like the three realms here.", "post1" %}

<sup>Audio manifests in various ways. DACs transform our signal from the digital realm to the analogue world. (Source: Wikimedia Commons.)</sup>
{.caption}

Since signal representations vastly differ, we need interfaces to bridge the different worlds. Between the digital and analogue realms, we have {% abbr "DACs", "Digital-to-Analogue Converters" %} and {% abbr "ADCs", "Analogue-to-Digital Converters" %} as mediators. Generally, DACs are used for output while ADCs are for input.


### A Closer Look at DACs 

Remember [sampling](/posts/digital-audio-synthesis-for-dummies-part-1#sampling)? We took a continuous analogue signal and selected discrete points at regular intervals. An ADC is like a glorified sampler.

{% image "assets/sampling.jpg", "Free samples have returned!", "post1" %}

<sup>ADC: line to dots. DAC: dots to line.</sup>
{.caption}

While ADCs take us from continuous to discrete, DACs (try to) take us from discrete to continuous. (Well, it tries anyway.) The shape of the resulting analogue waveform depends on the DAC implementation. Simple DACs will stagger the output at discrete levels. More complex DACs may interpolate between two discrete samples to ‚Äúguess‚Äù the intermediate values. Some of these guesses will be off, but at least the signal is smoother.


### Example: Initialising the DAC

Let‚Äôs return to CubeMX to set up our DAC.

{% image "assets/stm32-cubemx-dac-1.jpg", "DAC settings from CubeMX.", "post1" %}

<sup>Enable DAC, and connect it to Timer 8 using the trigger setting. Our STM32F405 board supports two DAC output channels. This is useful if we want stereo audio output.</sup>
{.caption}

{% image "assets/stm32-cubemx-dac-2.jpg", "DAC DMA settings from CubeMX.", "post1" %}

<sup>Configure DMA settings for the DAC. We‚Äôll cover DMA later.</sup>
{.caption}

{% image "assets/stm32-cubemx-dac-3.jpg", "Enable DAC DMA interrupts.", "post1" %}

<sup>Enable interrupts for the DMA. These are needed to trigger DAC sends.</sup>
{.caption}

Again, remember to generate code when finished.[^codegen] The `MX_DAC_Init()` function should contain the generated DAC setup code and should already be called in `main()`.

### Example: Using the DAC

On our STM32, DAC accepts samples [quantised](/posts/digital-audio-synthesis-for-dummies-part-1#quantisation) to 8 bits or 12 bits.[^dacalignment] We‚Äôll go with superior resolution: 12 bits!

{% image "assets/stm32-dac-alignment.jpg", "Three options for DAC alignment are offered.", "post1" %}

<sup>STM32 offers three different options to quantise and align DAC samples. We‚Äôll only focus on the last option: 12-bit right aligned samples. (Source: RM0090 Reference Manual.[^rm0090])</sup>
{.caption}

[^dacalignment]: There are pros to using 8-bit or 12-bit DAC. 8-bit conversion is faster, whereas 12-bit offers higher resolution. To slightly complicate things, the 12-bit DAC option on our STM32 can be aligned either left or right. That is, we can choose whether our data takes up the first 12 bits or last 12 bits on a 16-bit (2-byte) space. Alignment exists to [save you a shift operation](https://electronics.stackexchange.com/a/565451), which depends on your application.

[^rm0090]: [STM's Official Reference Manual for F405/F415, F407/F417, F427/F437, F429/F439 boards](https://www.st.com/resource/en/reference_manual/rm0090-stm32f405415-stm32f407417-stm32f427437-and-stm32f429439-advanced-armbased-32bit-mcus-stmicroelectronics.pdf). Definitely something to refer to if you‚Äôre working on one of those boards.

For simplicity, let‚Äôs start with sending 1 DAC sample. This can be done like so:

```cpp
// Start the DAC peripheral.
HAL_DAC_Start(&hdac, DAC_CHANNEL_1);

// Set the DAC value.
HAL_DAC_SetValue(&hdac, DAC_CHANNEL_1, DAC_ALIGN_12B_R, 1024);
```

This should output a voltage level of $\frac{1024}{4096} = 25\%$ of the reference voltage $V_{\text{REF}}$. Once started, the DAC will continue outputting at that voltage until we change the DAC value or call `HAL_DAC_Stop()`.

We use `DAC_CHANNEL_1` to select the first channel, and use `DAC_ALIGN_12B_R` to accept 12-bit samples aligned right.

To fire a continuous stream of samples, we could use a loop and call `HAL_DAC_SetValue()` repeatedly. Let‚Äôs use this method to generate a simple square wave.

{% alert "warning" %}
An aside. The default `HAL_Delay()` provided by STM will add 1ms to the delay time‚Äîwell, at least in my version. I overrode it using a separate definition so that it sleeps the given number of ms.

```cpp
void HAL_Delay(uint32_t ms)
{
    uint32_t start = HAL_GetTick();
    while ((HAL_GetTick() - start) < ms);
}
```
{% endalert %}

```cpp
HAL_DAC_Start(&hdac, DAC_CHANNEL_1);

// Alternate between high (4095) and low (0).
uint8_t high  = 1;
while (1) {
    uint16_t sample = (high ? 4095 : 0); // max = 4095 = 2^12 - 1.
    high = !high;
    HAL_DAC_SetValue(&hdac, DAC_CHANNEL_1, DAC_ALIGN_12B_R, sample);

    // Delay for 5ms.
    HAL_Delay(5);
}
```

This generates a square wave with a period of 10ms, for a frequency of 100Hz.

{% image "assets/osc-square-wave.jpg", "A square wave at 100Hz.", "post1" %}

<sup>Oscilloscope view of the signal. This is very useful for debugging signals, especially periodic ones.</sup>
{.caption}

But there are two issues with this looping method:

1. Using a while loop blocks the thread, meaning we block the processor from doing other things while outputting the sine wave.
2. Since `HAL_Delay()` delays in milliseconds, it becomes impossible to generate complex waveforms at high frequencies, since that requires us to send samples at **microsecond** intervals.

{% image "assets/y-u-no-faster.jpg", "HAL Delay, y u no faster?", "post1 w-80" %}

In the next section, we‚Äôll address these issues by combining DAC with timers and DMA.

## Direct Memory Access (DMA) üíâüß†

The final item on our agenda today! Direct Memory Access (DMA) may seem like three random words strung together, but it‚Äôs quite a powerful tool in the embedded programmer‚Äôs arsenal. How, you ask?

{% alert "success" %}
**DMA enables data transfer without consuming processor resources.** (Well, it consumes some resources, but mainly for setup.) This frees up the processor to do other things while DMA takes care of moving data. We could use this saved time to prepare the next set of buffers, render the GUI, etc.
{% endalert %}

DMA can be used to transfer data from memory-to-peripheral (e.g. DAC, {% abbr "UART", "A common asynchronous communication protocol in the embedded world." %} {% abbr "TX", "transfer" %}, SPI TX), from peripheral-to-memory (e.g. ADC, UART {% abbr "RX", "receive" %}), across peripherals, or across memory. In this post, we're concerned with one particular memory-to-peripheral transfer: DAC.

Further Reading:

- [Baeldung: How Do DMA Controllers Work?](https://www.baeldung.com/cs/dma-controllers)

### Example: DMA with Single Buffering

We'll now try using DMA with a single buffer, see why this is problematic, and motivate the need for double buffering.
If you‚Äôve read this far, I presume you‚Äôve followed the [previous section](#example-initialising-the-dac) by initialising DMA and generating code with CubeMX.

{% image "assets/single-buffer.jpg", "Single buffers... forever alone.", "post1 w-75" %}

{% alert "note" %}
Be aware that DMA introduces synchronisation issues. After preparing a second round of buffers, how do we know if the first round has already finished?

As with all processes which depend on a separate event, there are two approaches: polling and interrupts. We could block and wait until the first round is finished, then send‚Ä¶ or we could trigger an interrupt when it finishes, then start the next round inside the interrupt handler. The approach depends on your application.

In our examples, we‚Äôll poll to check if DMA is finished:

```cpp
while (HAL_DAC_GetState(&hdac) != HAL_DAC_STATE_READY)
    ;
```
{% endalert %}

With DMA, we‚Äôll first need to [buffer](/posts/digital-audio-synthesis-for-dummies-part-2/#buffering) an array of samples. Our loop will run like this:

1. Buffer samples.
2. Wait for DMA to be ready.
3. Start the DMA.

Do you notice a flaw in this approach? After starting DMA, we start buffering samples on the next iteration. We risk overwriting the buffer while it‚Äôs being sent.

Let‚Äôs try to implement it anyway and play a simple 440Hz sine wave.

```cpp
#include <math.h>  // M_PI, sin

#define SAMPLE_RATE 42000
#define BUFFER_SIZE 1024
#define FREQUENCY   440

uint16_t buffer[BUFFER_SIZE];
uint32_t t = 0; // Time (in samples).

// Start the timer.
HAL_TIM_Base_Start(&htim8);

while (1) {
    // Prep the buffer.
    for (int i = 0; i < BUFFER_SIZE; i++, t++) {
        float val = sin(2 * M_PI * FREQUENCY * t / SAMPLE_RATE);
        buffer[i] = 2047 * val + 2047; // Scale the value from [-1, 1] to [0, 2^12-1).
    }

    // Wait for DAC to be ready, so that the buffer can be modified on the next iteration.
    while (HAL_DAC_GetState(&hdac) != HAL_DAC_STATE_READY)
        ;

    // Start the DMA.
    HAL_DAC_Start_DMA(&hdac, DAC_CHANNEL_1, (uint32_t*)buffer, BUFFER_SIZE, DAC_ALIGN_12B_R);
}
```

The results? As expected, artefacts (nefarious little glitches) invade our signal, since our buffer is updated during DMA transfer. This may result in [unpleasant clicks from our speaker](/posts/digital-audio-synthesis-for-dummies-part-1#clicks).

{% image "assets/osc-sine-440-glitch.jpg", "Artefacts distort the signal, resulting in occasionally clips and sound defects.", "post1" %}

<sup>Prep, wait, start, repeat. Artefacts distort the signal from time to time.</sup>
{.caption}

But what if we prep, then start, then wait? This way, the buffer won't be overwritten; but this causes the signal to stall while prepping.^[Not sure if *stall* is the right word. Let me know if there's a better one.]

<a id="stall-img"></a>
{% image "assets/osc-sine-440-stall.jpg", "Oscilloscope of sine wave with stalls (horizontal breaks with no change).", "post1" %}

<sup>Prep, start, wait, repeat. The signal stalls (shown by horizontal lines) because the DAC isn‚Äôt updated while buffering.</sup>
{.caption}

To resolve these issues, we'll unleash the final weapon in our arsenal.


### Example: DMA with Double Buffering

We saw previously how a single buffer spectacularly fails to deal with "concurrent" buffering.
With double buffering, we introduce an additional buffer. While one buffer is being displayed/streamed, the other buffer is updated. This ensures our audio can be delivered in one continuous stream.

In code, we‚Äôll add another buffer by declaring `uint16_t[2][BUFFER_SIZE]` instead of `uint16_t[BUFFER_SIZE]`. We‚Äôll also declare a variable `curr` (0 or 1) to index which buffer is currently available.

```cpp
uint16_t buffers[2][BUFFER_SIZE]; // New: add a second buffer.
uint8_t curr = 0;                 // Index of current buffer.
uint32_t t   = 0;

// Start the timer.
HAL_TIM_Base_Start(&htim8);

while (1) {
    uint16_t* buffer = buffers[curr]; // Get the buffer being written.

    // --snip-- Same as before...
    // Prep the buffer.
    // Wait for DAC to be ready.
    // Start the DMA.
    // --snip--

    // Point to the other buffer, so that we
    // prepare it while the previous one
    // is being sent.
    curr = !curr;
}
```

Now our 440Hz sine wave is unblemished!

{% image "assets/osc-sine-440-2.jpg", "Pure sine goodness. A proper 440Hz sine displaying properly.", "post1" %}

<sup>Waveform of a pure 440Hz sine tone.</sup>
{.caption}

{% alert "fact" %}
Double buffering is also used for video and displays, where each buffer stores a 2D frame instead of a 1D signal.
{% endalert %}


### Example: Playing Multiple Notes with DMA and Double Buffering üé∂

With some minor changes, we can make our device generate audio for multiple notes. Let‚Äôs go ahead and play an A major chord!^[I love minor chords too, but it's not appropriate to play A minor. I'll see myself out. Hope you enjoyed the read.]

```cpp
// Prep the buffer.
uint16_t* buffer = buffers[curr];
for (int i = 0; i < BUFFER_SIZE; i++, t++) {
    // Compute value for each note.
    float a = sin(2 * M_PI * 440 * t / SAMPLE_RATE);
    float cs = sin(2 * M_PI * 554.37 * t / SAMPLE_RATE);
    float e = sin(2 * M_PI * 659.25 * t / SAMPLE_RATE);

    float val = (a + cs + e) / 3;  // Sum and normalise to [-1, 1].
    buffer[i] = 2047 * val + 2047; // Map [-1, 1] to [0, 2^12-1).
}
```

If you flash the above code and feed the output to an oscilloscope, you may find it doesn‚Äôt really work. Our signal [stalls](#stall-img), for similar reasons as before.

{% alert "warning" %}
Even with DMA, stalls may occur. This is usually a sign that buffering (and other processes) consume too much time. Once DMA is finished, nothing is being sent out.
{% endalert %}

### Optimisations üèé

So our code is slow. How do we speed it up?

Here are a few common tricks:

- **Precompute constants**.

    Instead of computing `2 * M_PI * FREQUENCY / SAMPLE_RATE` every iteration, we can precompute it before the loop, saving many arithmetic instructions.
    
    ```cpp
    // Precompute a factor of the 440Hz signal.
    float two_pi_f_over_sr = 2 * M_PI * FREQUENCY / SAMPLE_RATE;
    
    while (1) {
        // Prep the buffer.
        uint16_t* buffer = buffers[curr];
        for (int i = 0; i < BUFFER_SIZE; i++, t++) {
            // Use the precomputed value...
            buffer[i] = 2047 * sin(two_pi_f_over_sr * t) + 2047;
        }
    
        // ...
    }
    ```
    
- [**Wavetable synthesis**](/posts/digital-audio-synthesis-for-dummies-part-2/#wavetable-synthesis).

    Math functions such as `sin` can be computationally expensive, especially when used a lot. By caching the waveform in a lookup table, we can speed up the process of computing samples.

- **Increase the buffer size**.

    By increasing the buffer size, we spend less overhead switching between tasks.
    
- **Decrease the sample rate**.

    If all else fails, we can decrease the load by compromising the sample rate, say from 42000Hz to 21000Hz. With a buffer size of 1024, that means we‚Äôve gone from a constraint of $\frac{1,024}{42,000} = 24.4$ms to $\frac{1,024}{21,000} = 48.8$ms per buffer.

To avoid complicating things, I lowered the sample rate to 21000Hz. This means changing the auto-reload register to 7999, so that our timer frequency is $$\frac{168,000,000}{(0 + 1) \times (7,999 + 1)} = 21,\\!000\text{Hz.}$$

```cpp
TIM8->ARR = 7999;
```

After all this hassle, we get a beautiful chord.

## Recap üîÅ

By utilising both hardware and software, we reap the benefits of parallel processing while implementing an efficient, robust audio application. On the hardware side, we explored:

- [Timers](#timers), which are an useful and inexpensive way to trigger actions at regular intervals.
- [DACs](#digital-to-analogue-converters-dacs), which enable us to communicate with a speaker by translating digital samples into analogue signals.
- [DMA](#direct-memory-access-dma), which enables data transfer with minimal processor resources. This way, we can process other things while streaming audio.

In software, we explored:

- [Double buffering](#example-dma-with-double-buffering), a software technique for buffering data to achieve continuous or faster output.
- [Various optimisations](#optimisations), which enable us to squeeze more processing into our tiny board.

When combined, we save processing resources, which can possibly be spent on additional features.

In case you want to go further, here are some other things to explore:

- Generating stereo audio. We‚Äôve generated audio for Channel 1. What about stereo audio for Channel 2? If you‚Äôre using reverb effects and wish for a fuller stereo sound, you‚Äôll need an extra pair of buffers (and more processing!).
- Streaming via UART. It's possible to use DMA with other peripherals. Definitely worth exploring.
- Using {% abbr "SIMD", "Single Instruction, Multiple Data" %} instructions to buffer two (or more) samples at the same time.
- {% abbr "RTOS", "Real-Time Operating System" %} for multitasking.
- Other boards or hardware with specialised audio features.
