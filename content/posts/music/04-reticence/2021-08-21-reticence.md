Something about the past few years has been very poignantâ€”deep, memorable, touching yet almost hurting; somewhat close yet also far; cold and distant yet warm inside.

_Reticence_ was composed as a final project for an introductory course to music composition. Originally, I wanted the piece to be faster and more brisk (akin to a stressed state of mind). But after some reflection (and on further advice by instructors), I settled with a slower tempo. Following further modifications, the final result attempts to capture a held back, cold yet comforting, and ultimately poignant mood.

The piece was performed by Galison Lau and Ka Lap Wong in the final concert of the course. The SoundCloud upload is a software rendition.
