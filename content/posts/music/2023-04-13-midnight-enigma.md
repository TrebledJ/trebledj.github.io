_Midnight Enigma_ is composed for a [musical challenge][chal] constraining pitches within two octaves (here, G2-G3 + G4-G5), with the bonus theme of game music. I had to cut some corners melodically, but having this constraint also meant I can focus on and explore other aspects of music: the rhythm, extended chords, microtones, and whatnot. I also decided to play around with the Phrygian mode[^phrygian] a bit more, so that was fun.

[^phrygian]: The Phrygian mode is characterised by the flat-2nd. As _Midnight Enigma_ is primarily in C minor, the flat-2nd would be the D-flat.

I decided to go with a minimalist/band/electronic fusion with a mix of drums, Reichian phasing, and electronic-inspired delay. I enjoy the concept of open world games such as Minecraftâ€”a huge number of possibilities lie at your fingertips, and consequences aren't as drastic as in real life. A majority of the piece was composed during midnight hours in the days before the competition deadline, hence the title. (Yes, I messed up my sleep schedule then.)

This was my first time using MIDI vocals. They sound better than I expected; might reuse it in future pieces. :)

Enjoy~
