Dedicated to everyone feeling stressed, down, lost, or under the weather.

As we all know, penguins are great swimmers. Sadly however they can't fly (or so we think!). But as the ["Learn to Fly" game series][ltf] teaches us, with enough dedication, penguins can indeed fly. And with each attempt they reach higher altitudes, even if simply done using a tiny booster rocket.

Hopefully this little piece may be a booster rocket for you.
