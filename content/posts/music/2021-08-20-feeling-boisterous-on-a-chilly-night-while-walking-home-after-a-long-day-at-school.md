That feeling when you boisterously walk (or bike, drive, swim, fly) home on a chilly night after a long day at school.

This piece was composed as a final project for an introductory course to electronic music composition. Most parts were written as MIDI and fed into digital synths. The recurring bleeps were collected from an EuroRack analogue synth with the Ren√© sequencer.

The direction I went for was contemplative and cheerful, as captured by the opening section and bouncy piano synth.
