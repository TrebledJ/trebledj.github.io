It's been three and a half years since I began my journey with HKUST. To me, the university is like a garden: cultivating and nurturing flora and fauna, a peaceful sanctuary, a place of life and beauty. Being situated near the sea, HKUST stands firm as waves ceaselessly crash against its foundation.

Composed in the final week of the year 2022 and released on New Year's Day 2023, may this song instill vision and harmony in learning and teaching throughout the HKUST community.
