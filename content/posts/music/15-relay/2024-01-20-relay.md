"Relay" can mean several things... It could be a race—passing a baton from one to the next. It could be the passing of packets by a router or a gateway server. Or used plainly as a verb without technicalities, it may simply mean to receive and pass on information.^[It might also (in my mind) be a play-on of "**r**hythmic d**elay**".]

It's worth taking a moment to reflect: what are we relaying? As time passes, more responsibility falls on our shoulders—the responsibility to be helpful (or useful?) in society; the responsibility to mentor; the responsibility to work, to execute; the responsibility to lead.

What are we relaying? What torch are we passing on? What is our *light*? And what keeps us moving?

The average human [works 90,000 hours](https://www.gettysburg.edu/news/stories?id=79db7b34-630c-4f49-ad32-4ab9ea48e72b). There's only so much experience, wealth, and knowledge we can accrue.

> *Light the torch and guide us through the dark.*  
> *Shadows, dispelled by balls of flame.*  
> *Relay to us this bright white shining spark.*  
> *Ready, for the race to carry on.*  
> <sup>*(Some words to go along with the climactic sections.)*</sup>

*Similar to [Remorse](/posts/remorse), Relay was featured as part of a challenge in the HKUST Firebird CTF 2024 competition, a competition where teams hunt for hidden pieces of text.*
