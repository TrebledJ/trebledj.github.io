This piece was composed for a fun little musical challenge with the constraint of using 13/16 metre. I chose to blend Cuban rhythms, some sweet little tunes, and various love themes (see if you recognise any!). 

The piece has been arranged for a variety of instruments, including violin, piano, double bass, castanets, and drums. The bass, castanets, and drums primarily generate rhythm and provide the swaying dance line, while the violin and piano are responsible for the melody.

If you‚Äôre inclined to dance with abandon (as encouraged by Spotify advertisements), go ahead. üòÑ

Happy Valentine's Day, God bless, and enjoy~ ‚ù§Ô∏è
