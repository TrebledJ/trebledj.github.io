#### Ordered

1. First, you take a soap bar.
2. You wring it out dry, using your favourite hair dryer.
3. Next, you take royal honey, from the royalist bees.
4. You cook the honey, let it steam for 20 minutes, meticulously adding seasoning such as garnished carbon and torn hair.
5. Once the honey has steamed well, it should stick profusely to the wok. Breathe into it.
6. ~~Extract~~ Untame the stuck honey, and crumbulate it in the Rockwell *dual-gyzmo combobulator*.
7. Finally, to ensure everything works out, and you don't violate time-space operation principles, you [***shove it up your butt***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a8LaIME66M).

Let's try that again.

1. First, you take a soap bar.

    You wring it out dry, using your favourite hair dryer.

    > As a famous person once said, a dry soap is better a dead horse. - Anon.

2. Next, you take royal honey, from the royalist bees.

    ```c
    printf("Bzzz... target acquired~");
    ```

    You cook the honey, let it steam for 20 minutes, meticulously adding seasoning such as garnished carbon and torn hair.

3. Once the honey has steamed well, it should stick profusely to the wok. Breathe into it.
   
    {% alert "warning" %}  
        Make sure the **honey** is as *yellow* as this box. If not, you may have accidentally steamed royal pee instead of royal honey.^[Royal pee is an extreme form of royal honey, but boasts different characteristics, which aren't enough to fit the margin of this page. It's great for other recipes though.]  
    {% endalert %}

4. ~~Extract~~ Untame the stuck honey, and crumbulate it in the Rockwell *dual-gyzmo combobulator*.

According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly.

Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't *care* what humans think is impossible.
