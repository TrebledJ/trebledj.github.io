Capstone project for my final semester at HKUST.

For my capstone project, I served as an embedded software developer at [WeShare Technology](https://www.wesharetechnology.com/), programming a smart-tracking tray to track chemicals in a wet lab environment. The tray revolutionises the lab environment by automating manual processes. It collects various chemical data (weight, RFID) and interfaces with a backend service to process and analyse the data.

My role pertains to developing and improving the embedded software infrastructure. In the process, I enhanced the tray with an RTOS, a unit testing framework, and numerous software improvements.
