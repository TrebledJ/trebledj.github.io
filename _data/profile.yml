  Hi! I'm a final year HKUST mathematics undergrad.
  I'm passionate about [programming](/tags/programming/) and [composing music](/tags/composition/).
  I'm also interested in a wide range of fields: [robotics](/tags/robotics/), [cybersecurity](/tags/ctf/),
  [application development](/tags/apps/), and software engineering in general.
  I'm excited about developing applications to solve problems and provide an educational interface for learners.
