  Hi! I'm a final year HKUST mathematics undergrad.
  I'm passionate about [programming](/tags/programming) and [composing music](/tags/composition).
  I'm also interested in a wide range of fields: [robotics](/tags/robotics), [cybersecurity](/tags/ctf),
  [application development](/tags/apps), and software engineering in general.
  I'm excited about developing applications to solve problems and provide an educational interface for learners.
  Mostly I've been working on desktop apps, but I've been looking into web as well.
  Also, I'm not afraid of pineapple on pizza ~~unlike some people *cough cough* :P~~.
