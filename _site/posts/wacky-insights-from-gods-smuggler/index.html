He is portrayed with a rebellious spirit and strong desire to make a difference to the world.</p><p>Through various encounters with God, Andrew’s faith deepened and his restlessness to share God’s message grew. As his character develops, his faith becomes a central source of courage, resilience, and a profound sense of purpose.</p><p>As I read this book, it struck me how the book offers scandalous perspectives to life—ones backed by faith and a dependence on God. To be honest, these perspectives are nothing new.

Cease Control</h2><blockquote><p><em>And so, for the first of many times, I said the Prayer of God's Smuggler:</em></p><p><em>'Lord, in my luggage I have Scripture that I want to take to Your children across this border. When You were on earth, You made blind eyes see. Now, I pray, make seeing eyes blind. Do not let the guards see those things You do not want them to see.'</em></p><p>– Brother Andrew, Lanterns in the Dark, Page 117.</p></blockquote><p>One aspect to living a Christ-fearing life lies in the <em>Cost of Discipleship</em>: to give up plans and desires for the sake of Christ. With the amount of travelling Andrew goes through, it’s only a matter of time before stringent border checks catch up with him.</p><p>In another instance, this relinquishment is spelled out more explicitly—a direct plea, but also a humble deference to Christ.</p><blockquote><p><em>'Lord,' I went on, 'I know that no amount of cleverness on my part can get me through this border search. Dare I ask for a miracle? Let me take some of the Bibles out and leave them in the open where they will be seen. Then, Lord, I cannot possibly be depending on my own stratagems, can I? I will be depending utterly upon You.'</em></p><p>– Brother Andrew, The Greenhouse in the Garden, Page 185.</p></blockquote><p>This character reflects how we can live a Christ-directed life through prayer, rather than living a self-directed life.</p><div class="center rw mb-2 h-auto lightbox-gallery"><a class="" title="Self-directed life." href="/img/posts/faith/01-gods-smuggler/assets/fsl4-1-315w.webp"><img class="multi rw" src="/img/posts/faith/01-gods-smuggler/assets/fsl4-1-315w.webp" loading="lazy" decoding="async" style="width:44.44%;aspect-ratio: auto 315 / 160" alt="Self is on the throne.

After all, it requires us to deny ourselves and carry a cross (figuratively of course; Luke 14:27). We might not live a life as exciting as Brother Andrew's, but we could still serve God and experience joy in the process.</p><details><summary>Context</summary><div class="details-content"><blockquote><p><em>The Yugoslav Government in 1957 permitted visitors to bring in only articles for their personal use. Anything new or anything in quantity was suspect because of the black market thriving all over the country. Printed material especially was liable to be confiscated at the border, no matter how small the quantity, because [coming] from out of the country, it was regarded as foreign propaganda. Now here I was with car and luggage literally bulging with tracts, Bibles, and portions of Bibles. How was I to get them past the border guard? And so, for the first of many times, I said the Prayer of God's Smuggler:</em></p><p><em>'Lord, in my luggage I have Scripture that I want to take to Your children across this border. When You were on earth, You made blind eyes see. Now, I pray, make seeing eyes blind. Do not let the guards see those things You do not want them to see.'</em></p><p><em>And so, armed with this prayer, I started the motor and drove up to the barrier...</em></p><p>– Brother Andrew, Lanterns in the Dark, Page 117-118.</p></blockquote><p>In a separate trip to Romania…</p><blockquote><p><em>It took me four hours to get across the Rumanian border. When I pulled up to the checkpoint on the other side of the Danube, I said to myself, 'Well, I'm in luck. Only half a dozen cars. This will go swiftly.'</em></p><p><em>When forty minutes had passed and the first car was still being inspected, I thought, 'Poor fellow, they must have something on him to take so long.'</em></p><p><em>But when that car finally left and the next inspection took half an hour too, I began to worry. Literally everything that family was carrying had to be taken out and spread on the ground. Every car in the line was put through the same routine. The fourth inspection lasted for well over an hour. The guards took the driver inside and kept him there while they removed hubcaps, took his engine apart, removed seats.</em></p><p><em>'Dear Lord,' I said, as at least there was just one car ahead of me, 'what am I going to do? Any serious inspection will show up those Rumanian Bibles right away.</em></p><p><em>'Lord,' I went on, 'I know that no amount of cleverness on my part can get me through this border search. Dare I ask for a miracle? Let me take some of the Bibles out and leave them in the open where they will be seen. Then, Lord, I cannot possibly be depending on my own stratagems, can I? I will be depending utterly upon You.'</em></p><p>While the last car was going through its chilling inspection, I managed to take several Bibles from their hiding places and pile them on the seat beside me.</p><p><em>It was my turn. I put the little VW in low gear, inched up to the officer standing at the left side of the road, handed him my papers, and started to get out. But his knee was against the door, holding it closed. He looked at my photograph in the passport, scribbled something down, shoved the papers back under my nose, and abruptly waved me on.</em></p><p><em>Surely thirty seconds had not passed. I started the engine and inched forward. Was I supposed to pull over, out of the way, where the car could be taken apart? Was I... surely I wasn't... I coasted forward, my foot poised above the brake. Nothing happened...</em></p><p><em>My heart was racing.

On Singleness</h2><blockquote><p><em>'Some people, Lord, are built for the lonely walk.'</em><br>– Brother Andrew, The Third Prayer, Page 132.</p></blockquote><p>In this prayer, Andrew acknowledges some people are gifted for singleness. Despite social stigma, singleness is also a valid calling. Not everyone is called to be intertwined with another hooman.</p><p>This idea is reflected in 1 Corinthians 7:7, where the apostle Paul addresses singleness and marriage. Neither status should be looked down upon, as people are capable of serving God either way. Some people serve best when alone. Some serve better in a team, as a couple. It really depends on God's calling (1 Corinthians 7:17).</p><details><summary>Context</summary><div class="details-content"><p>At the start of this chapter, Andrew prayed for a wife, but was directed to Isaiah 54:1: "<em>The children of the desolate are more than the children of the married.</em>", implying his ministry to the spiritually lost should come first before marriage. Yet, he prayed another prayer:</p><blockquote><p><em>'Lord', I said one morning, sitting on the little iron fold-down bed in my room over the toolshed, 'I've got to pray just one more time about this bachelor life You plan for me. Now I know about those children You promise the desolate, but Lord, You also promise the desolate a home!' I quickly found the verse in Psalm 68, as though to refresh His memory: "God gives the desolate a home to dwell in." 'It isn't that I don't thank You for this room about the toolshed, Lord. Just because it's dark and dank and mildewy and – doesn't mean I'm not grateful. But, dear God, it is not a home. Not really. A home is where there's a wife and children – real ones.</em></p><p><em>'Lord, Paul prayed three times for release from the torn in the flesh that was bothering him. And you refused him. I have prayed twice for a wife. I am going to pray once more. Perhaps You will refuse me a third time, too, Lord, and if You do, I shall never again bring up the question. I'm going to write it here in my Bible.' I opened the Bible to the back cover and scribbled one last notation, 'Prayed ... for ... wife ... third time ... Witte, 7th July ... 1957.' Then I closed the Bible with a snap, 'Some people, Lord, are built for the lonely walk. But not me, please. Not me.'</em></p><p>– Brother Andrew, "The Third Prayer", Page 132.</p></blockquote><p>Although much of the passage sees Andrew asking for a wife, I thought the last bit was amusing and deserves a bit of attention.</p><p>If anything, the casual tone of the prayer goes to show how close Andrew regards God, like an understanding friend.</p><div class="details-collapse-bottom"><sub><a class="details-collapse-button">(collapse)</a></sub></div></div></details><details><summary>Relevant Verses</summary><div class="details-content"><blockquote><p><em><sup>7</sup>I wish that all men were as I am.

In Transylvania we visited such a family. These Christians had a poultry farm which was still at least partially their own property. However, the state had given them a production quota that was beyond their capacity to meet. When they failed to reach it, they had to buy enough eggs on the open market to make up the difference. Year after year this had happened, and the economic suffering was great.</em></p><p><em>'Why do you stay then? So that you can keep your farm?' I asked.</em></p><p><em>The farmer and his wife both looked shocked. 'Of course not,' he said. 'In fact, we certainly will lose the farm.

Technology is in His Hands</h2><p>Perhaps one of the most thrilling aspects of <em>Brother Andrew</em> is</p><ol><li>his relationship with technology, and</li><li>how God uses technology (in surprising ways!).</li></ol><p>Of all technological innovations in the 20th century, much of the book was dominated by cars. It makes sense in hindsight. Andrew does a lot of travelling. Of course, he would need a car. It's the most flexible means of travel (and probably the most cost-effective).</p><p>It started off with impromptu driving lessons by a peer, Karl de Graaf. Imagine going about your work when all of a sudden, you're told to learn how to drive.</p><blockquote><p><em>'Hello, Andy. Do you know how to drive?'</em></p><p><em>'Drive?'</em></p><p><em>'An automobile.'</em></p><p><em>'No,' I said, bewildered. 'No, I don't.'</em></p><p><em>'Because last night in our prayers we had a word from the Lord about you. It's important for you to be able to drive.'</em></p><p>[...]</p><p><em>A week later the dike builder drove up to the door again.</em></p><p><em>'Have you been taking your driving lessons?'</em></p><p><em>'Well – not exactly...'</em></p><p><em>'Haven't you learned yet how important obedience is? I suppose I'm going to have to teach you myself. Hop in.'</em></p><p><em>That afternoon I sat behind the wheel of a motor vehicle for the first time since that disastrous morning eleven years earlier when I had driven the Bren carrier full speed down the company street. Mr de Graaf returned again and again, and so skilled a teacher was he that a few weeks later I took my driving test and pass it the first time around—a rare thing in Holland. I still could see no reason why I—who didn't even own a bicycle any more—should be carrying an automobile driver's licence around in my pocket. But Mr de Graaf refused to speculate. 'That's the excitement in obedience,' he said. 'Finding out later what God had in mind.'</em></p><p>– Brother Andrew, The Foundations are Laid, Page 109.</p></blockquote><p>A few page flips later, Andrew found a use for his driver's licence...</p><blockquote><p><em>'This is Andrew calling. How lucky to find you home in the middle of the day.'</em></p><p><em>'I thought you were in Berlin.'</em></p><p><em>'I am.'</em></p><p><em>'We were sorry to hear about your father.'</em></p><p><em>'Thank you. But this call is good news, Mr Whetstra. I just had to tell you. I have in my hand two pieces of paper. One is a letter from the Yugoslavian consulate in Holland turning down my request for a visa, and the other is my passport, stamped with a visa by the Yugoslav people here. I've got it, Mr Whetstra! I'm going behind the Curtain as a missionary!'</em></p><p><em>'Andrew, you'd better come home for your keys.'</em></p><p><em>'I'm sorry, Mr Whetstra, this is a bad connection. I thought you said keys.'</em></p><p><em>'I did. To your Volkswagen. We've talked it all over, and there's no untalking us. Mrs Whetstra and I decided months ago that if you got the visa, you also got our automobile. Come home and pick up the keys.'</em></p><p>– Brother Andrew, The Foundations are Laid Page 114</p></blockquote><p>Oh joy. Free car!</p><p>Even when the car engine died, God had an exercise planned.</p><blockquote><p><em>This was all His timing, and the question of the money was also in His hands. I was not worried, just fascinated to see how He was going to work it all out.</em></p></blockquote><details><summary>Context</summary><div class="details-content"><blockquote><p><em>'My crew leaves in ten minutes. They could have a new engine in for you in an hour, but you'd have to pay them a good tip for staying overtime.</em></p><p><em>'How much would the whole thing cost, including the tip?'</em></p><p><em>'Five hundred marks.'</em></p><p><em>Without hesitation I said, 'Go ahead. I'll go and get some more money changed at the train station.'</em></p><p><em>It was on board the streetcar going to the station that I counted my money and realised that all I had with me would not make five hundred marks. There'd be no help from the two students back at the garage: they were riding with me in the first place because they were flat broke.</em></p><p><em>Should I go back and cancel the work order? No. I could see God's hand too clearly in all of this. Stopping precisely at the emergency telephone, having the engine wear out here in Germany where it came from, rather than in some distant and hostile spot where replacement would have been impossible and questions awkward. I was far too familiar with the way Christ looks after the practical side of the ministry to miss these signs. This was all His timing, and the question of the money was also in His hands. I was not worried, just fascinated to see how He was going to work it all out.</em></p><p><em>When I had changed every last guilder, it came—with the German money in my pocket—to 470 marks. Fifty shy of the amount I needed to pay the bill and to buy gasoline on the way home.</em></p><p><em>'Well,' I said to myself, 'something will happen on the streetcar going back.'</em></p><p><em>But nothing did. I got to the garage to find the workmen just finishing up and my two passengers nowhere to be seen. They'd gone for a walk, one of the men said, packing away his tools. The others were cleaning up too. I could delay the moment of reckoning no longer.</em></p><p><em>And at that instant, the two young Dutchmen raced through the door, one of them waving something in his hand. 'Andy!' he shouted. 'Craziest thing ever happened to me! We were just walking along the street when this lady came up to us and asked if we were Dutchmen. When I said yes, she gave me this bill! She said God wanted us to have it!' The bill was for fifty marks.</em></p><p>– Brother Andrew, The Work Begins to Expand, Page 203-204.</p></blockquote><div class="details-collapse-bottom"><sub><a class="details-collapse-button">(collapse)</a></sub></div></div></details><p>And finally, a modern take on technology:</p><blockquote><p><em>Although he sometimes walks the three miles to the Dutch offices of Open Doors, where all the modern technological wonders are in use, Andrew's personal workplace is not connected to the Internet and has no fax or answering machine.</em></p><p><em>'And I won't even consider installing one of those call-waiting monstrosities,' he exclaimed, 'that interrupt one phone conversation to announce another.' Technology, Andrew says, makes us far too accessible to the demands and pressures of the moment. 'Our first priority should be listening in patience and silence for the voice of God.'</em></p><p>– Brother Andrew, The Journey in the New Millennium, Page 277.</p></blockquote><p>This last statement is true. Sometimes I wonder if I place technology (apps, games, notifications) first, before God... and I shudder at the thought. Thankfully, most phones now come with <em>Do Not Disturb</em>, but without self-discipline it's pointless.</p><h2 id="concluding-remarks" tabindex="-1"><a class="md-anchor" href="#concluding-remarks" aria-hidden="true"></a> Concluding Remarks</h2><p>Quick recap:</p><ul><li>Cease control.
