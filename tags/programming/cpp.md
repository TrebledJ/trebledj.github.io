C++ is a general-purpose [programming](/tags/programming) language created by Danish computer scientist Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the [C programming language](/tags/c), or "C with Classes". The language has expanded significantly over time, and modern C++ now has object-oriented, generic, and functional features in addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation.
